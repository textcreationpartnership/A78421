            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>1. <hi>The Preface of</hi> D. H. <hi>return'd.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THat Dr. <hi>Hamond</hi> hath taken great (and needleſs) pains, to ſhew me the <hi>infirm parts</hi> of my three-fold <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribe,</hi> with, and againſt himſelf, of <hi>Superſtition, Will-worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals,</hi> (which came abroad above a twelvemoneth before.) I am now obliged to take <hi>notice,</hi> and to deſign a few dayes (for which he hath had months) to vindicate that little <hi>David</hi> from his great <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> his <hi>Voluminous Diſcourſe;</hi> which ſurely need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, had not the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of mine been more, then he will willingly acknowledge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His two former of thoſe three <hi>Tracts,</hi> I had never ſeen nor heard of, till the time I was referred to them in his third of <hi>Feſtivals, Page</hi> 425. where he ſends his Reader to them, and to his <hi>Practical Catechiſm,</hi> for Arguments againſt the <hi>Superſtition,</hi> and <hi>Will worſhip,</hi> charged upon his <hi>Feſtival:</hi> And what ever his <hi>Deſign</hi> was, to remove (as he ſayes) thoſe two charges againſt the Church; and what ever the ſucceſs thereof was, I know not. This I am ſure of, taking thoſe words of <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi> in the generally received ſenſe of moſt <hi>Reformed Divines</hi> and <hi>Churches,</hi> he hath not freed himſelf, and others his <hi>Aſſociates,</hi> from thoſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170718:3"/>charges, nor at all demonſtrated them to be <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> therefore may be diſcharged of thoſe <hi>Accuſations,</hi> though he and ſome other of her Sons, do juſtly lie as guilty under them. I deſire the Reader (as he does) that he will but <hi>calmly</hi> and indifferently <hi>review</hi> the Treatiſes on both ſides, and then give ſentence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Particular <hi>Application</hi> of general <hi>Caſes</hi> or <hi>Truths</hi> (its true) does ſtir the coals: and then complaints and contentions begin, when the <hi>Salt</hi> is applied to the raw and ſorer parts. For this he might have had proof enough in his own boſom, nearer hand. For till the <hi>Charges</hi> came home to himſelf, rather then to the <hi>Feſtival;</hi> and his own opinion and practice were brought as proofs of his <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi> in obſervation of his <hi>Feſtival,</hi> all was quiet. But when it was ſaid, <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> are of larger <hi>lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> then he takes them; and that by his own <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> he is concluded guilty of them, in other ſenſes given by him; hence I fear ariſe this large <hi>Account,</hi> if not to <hi>excuſe</hi> himſelf, yet to <hi>obſcure</hi> and hide his <hi>guilt,</hi> by diſſembling and concealing that <hi>particular charge,</hi> and all along anſwering no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it. As for me, that which engaged me in this conteſt, was, not onely my <hi>Tract</hi> of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> but a former Diſcourſe of <hi>Superſtition</hi> (with reſpect to <hi>Places</hi>) which was abroad, I believe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the former two Treatiſes of the Doctors, and <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with his principles. And indeed, theſe three Tracts of his, by me ſingled out from the reſt, have ſuch <hi>Affinity</hi> or <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> each with other, that I could not well <hi>deal</hi> with the laſt, but I muſt take in both the other. For it's in vain to go about to faſten <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> upon his <hi>obſervation</hi> of his <hi>Feſtival,</hi> till we are agreed what thoſe two are. It is not difficult for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170718:3"/>me to reconcile the <hi>Feſtival,</hi> with my Grounds for the <hi>Chriſtian Sabbath,</hi> one in a week, by the fourth Commandment. For I can and do allow upon juſt occaſions, a <hi>Day,</hi> or <hi>Dayes</hi> to be ſet apart by Superiour Powers, with due <hi>Cautions;</hi> as is held out, both in <hi>Sab. Rediv.</hi> and in <hi>pag.</hi> 198. of my laſt <hi>Diatribe:</hi> yet cannot but abhor the <hi>Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> introduced into his <hi>Feſtival,</hi> together with the <hi>Riot</hi> thereon attending.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And this my <hi>ſincere endeavour</hi> might have been for good, had it met with a ſpirit willing to yield to truth diſcovered. For the Doctor (I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire he may take notice of it) is by ſome of his own friends and admirers, held to have <hi>pelidae ſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chum, cedere neſcii: muſt and will</hi> (ſay they) <hi>have the laſt word.</hi> And this I obſerve in this <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi> when he is forced by better Reaſon to <hi>relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh</hi> ſome notions as not conſonant to truth of Scriptures; he does it ſo <hi>favourably</hi> to himſelf, as that there appears ſome <hi>reluctancy</hi> of ſpirit to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge himſelf miſtaken; I may give inſtances hereafter. For my part; I did but with a ſpirit of <hi>Meekneſs</hi> (with all due <hi>reſpects</hi> to his worth and perſon) ſhew him ſome doubts and difficulties, and (as I thought) <hi>Weakneſſes</hi> in his <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> with my Reaſons rendred thereunto: (which his <hi>Alex: Aphrodiſaeus</hi> would have taken for a great <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>honour</hi>) and he does not onely <hi>ſlight</hi> my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, calling me commonly, <hi>the Diatribiſt;</hi> but my pains alſo, and profeſſes,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>[He is not by all my Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribe ſo inſtructed, or improved, as to diſcern one real miſadventure in thoſe Diſcourſes, and findes it impoſſible for him to be edified by my Charity.]</hi> Of his <hi>Miſadventures,</hi> I ſhall give him an account in due time and place; this is his great <hi>Miſcarriage,</hi> that he returns me <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>ſcorn</hi> for my good
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170718:4"/>will; <hi>ſharpneſs</hi> for meekneſs, and <hi>reproaches</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of thanks; as ſhall appear hereafter.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As we muſt be careful, <hi>[not to be affrighted from our obedience to Superiours upon every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Superſtition, &amp;c.]</hi> ſo we muſt not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured into <hi>Superſtition, &amp;c.</hi> upon every pretence of <hi>diſobedience</hi> to Superiours: This latter is of greateſt concernment, becauſe no <hi>Authority</hi> can juſtifie us in the leaſt <hi>corruption</hi> of the Worſhip of God; God himſelf having ſeverely threatned ſuch, as under pretence of <hi>Love</hi> to him,

                  </note> and his ſervice, do indeed <hi>hate</hi> him, by introducing <hi>Worſhip</hi> to him, which he never commanded. As for thoſe things [<hi>of a more ſublime conſideration,</hi> (as he ſpeaks) <hi>the Free-will-offerings, well becoming a Chriſtian to bring to Chriſt, and rewardable in an high degree, ſuch as the higheſt Charities, Devotions, and moſt heroical Chriſtian practices</hi>] we ſhall be far from <hi>degrading</hi> or <hi>defaming</hi> them, when they are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered and rightly <hi>diſtinguiſhed.</hi> But how the Doctor <hi>inſinuates</hi> ſecretly an opinion of his Adverſaries, (which is utterly falſe, and the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, all along his diſcourſe) <hi>[That they conclude every thing to be criminous, which is not neceſſary; and all uncommanded practices unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,]</hi> which they ſay onely of <hi>uncommanded Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. My <hi>impartiality</hi> in examining what he wrote, was not with reſpect to his <hi>perſon,</hi> but to the <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf, which I thought I ſaw much <hi>obſcured,</hi> if not <hi>oppreſſed</hi> by him. My end was the ſame with his, <hi>[The ſeaſonable checking and reformation of ſome Vices</hi> (viz. <hi>Superſtition and Will-worſhip) or the confirmation and increaſe of Vertue, to the glory of God, &amp;c.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. But I dare not be ſo <hi>confident,</hi> as he is, to

                  <hi>boaſt</hi> in a manner, <hi>[That this hath been the onely aim of all hitherto publiſht by him; and ſo fully ſatisfied in himſelf thereof, that he doubts not to approve it to any that can make queſtion of it.]</hi> What? even to God himſelf? Is not the heart <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful</hi> above all things? Did not <hi>Paul</hi> think he aimed at Gods glory in <hi>perſecuting</hi> the Truth? Do not the <hi>Advocates</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> confidently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſame end, with him, in propagating their <hi>Errors</hi> and Superſtitions? Is not the Doctor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a man, <hi>animal gloriae?</hi> Does not much learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and knowledge puff up? and cauſe the owners to ſtart up new marks of <hi>ſelf-reputation</hi> and <hi>vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory?</hi> But this I can freely grant, <hi>[That in ſuch Doctrines (as theſe before us) which have imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate influence upon practice, it is charity to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the diſabuſing of all, and not to ſuffer any fruitful and noxious Errour upon my neighbour,]</hi> which (if my heart deceive me not) was one ground of my undertaking his three <hi>Treatiſes.</hi>

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>n.</hi> 5.</note> my next <hi>Injuſtice</hi> is, <hi>[That I have no where demonſtrated Will-worſhip,</hi> to be as criminal as <hi>Hereſie.]</hi> To which I ſay, there is but a little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Will-worſhip;</hi> the latter, in the bad ſenſe, (acknowledged by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor himſelf, <hi>pag.</hi> 96. <hi>n.</hi> 6.) being but a ſpecies of the former: If <hi>Superſtition</hi> be (as it is) demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to be as criminal as <hi>hereſie, Wil-worſhip</hi> will partake with it in that <hi>vicioſity.</hi> I have no more to ſay to this <hi>ſection</hi> and <hi>number,</hi>

He denies any ſuch thing as <hi>Nimiety</hi> or exceſs in Religion, in regard of <hi>Intenſion,</hi> or degree: how then was I <hi>miſtaken</hi> in charging him with it? 2. His reaſon rendred is as ſtrange; <hi>[Becauſe all our faults are omiſſions and defects, not exceſſes of Piety.]</hi> Does not the Doctor <hi>prevaricate</hi> here? Firſt, by varying the words, from (in <hi>Religion</hi>) to (of <hi>Religion,)</hi> There may be <hi>exceſs in Religion,</hi> (which yet he denies) though ſpeaking properly, there is no exceſs of <hi>Religion;</hi> ſo the great <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> explains himſelf; <hi>[Not that in true conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, a man can give God too much, but rather too little, in not giving him what he requires.]</hi> Yet he ſays, <hi>[Superſtition is a vice contrary to Religion in the exceſs,]</hi> that is, an exceſs in Religion.

And again, to make all our <hi>faults</hi> (in Religion) to be <hi>omiſſions,</hi> he denies any ſins of <hi>commiſſion</hi> in the firſt Table:

That theſe Doctrines concerned the <hi>worſhip</hi> of God, and ſo Additions to the <hi>Rule</hi> of worſhip, in vain do they worſhip me: and are not theſe <hi>Additons, exceſſes?</hi> what ſenſe then is there in his new coin'd gloſs? <hi>[Doctrines thore ſimply ſignifying, not that addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that to which the addition was made.]</hi> What means he? that <hi>Doctrines</hi> ſignifies the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture?</hi> for to that the <hi>Addition</hi> was made; ſo he ſayes, <hi>[Adding them to the Scriptures]</hi> what? their own <hi>Traditions:</hi> Then their <hi>Doctrines</hi> were added to the Scripture; but were not Scripture, and if not Scripture, <hi>Additions</hi> to the Scripture. 2. But my next infirmity is, that I ſay, <hi>[Thoſe Additions, are called Will-worſhip;]</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary whereof, (he ſayes) is proved in the Treatiſe of <hi>Will-worſhip:</hi> I ſhall not anticipate the place: All I ſay now is but this: If it be <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi> to deviſe <hi>new ſorts</hi> of worſhip, and to offer them to God, for <hi>worſhip:</hi> (as the Doctor confeſſes it is, <hi>pag.</hi>

Then thoſe <hi>Additions</hi> may well be called <hi>Will-worſhip;</hi> and ſuch <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> may very well be called, an <hi>Addition</hi> to the Rule of worſhip. 3. This is yet another of my miſtakes; <hi>[That additions to the rule of worſhip, are any where in the New Teſtament called Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition: I deſire he would ſhew me one ſuch place, for my concordance will not afford it me.]</hi> Let him not <hi>evade,</hi> by thoſe words, <hi>[Called Superſtition,]</hi> That is, in <hi>ſo many words,</hi> and I will ſhew many places, where the thing is apparant; that Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is an <hi>Addition</hi> to the word, and <hi>Additions</hi> to the word, are <hi>Superstition.</hi> But in ſtead of all, I

Do not Idolatres, <hi>Polytheiſts</hi> (ſuch as theſe <hi>Athenians</hi> were) meddle with, and adde to the rule of worſhip? ſurely then none in the world do: Is it not a moral Law written in the hearts of all men, (though blotted much) that God alone is to be worſhipped? do not they that worſhip other Gods, with, or without him, meddle with, and adde to this rule of worſhip? 2. Does it become the Doctors Learning and Divinity, to make adulterers (and ſo every ſinner in the ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) to be (with them afore) ſtilled Superſtitious? when worſhip (and ſo Superſtition) is onely in the firſt Table? let the Reader judge.</p>

Then he undertakes to put my argument into <hi>form:</hi> but that I refuſe; and <hi>renounce</hi> his whole Syllogiſme, as none of mine; upon this ground, becauſe he hath <hi>changed</hi> the queſtion, from <hi>uncommanded

So alſo is the worſhipping the true God, after an undue and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful manner, (an exceſs.) <hi>ergo,</hi> Superſtition is of larger extent, then the <hi>worſhipping</hi> of <hi>Daemons:</hi> which both, the Doctor ſeems to deny.

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>n.</hi> 17.</note> 
                  <hi>[My pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions in that place, were onely this, that Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition among all Authors ſignified not any crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous exceſs.]</hi> Does he mean, that <hi>Superſtition</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in any <hi>Authors,</hi> ſignifies a <hi>criminous</hi> exceſs? That he cannot ſay, or that all <hi>Authors</hi> do not take it for a <hi>criminous</hi> exceſs? (the words may bear both ſenſes) that's too <hi>dilate</hi> for the Doctor to affirm; It's enough for us, if in <hi>ſome Authors,</hi> both <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Divine,</hi> it ſignifie a <hi>criminous</hi> exceſs: and if <hi>Superſtitioſus</hi> ſo ſignifie, ſo may <hi>Superſtitio,</hi> from whence it comes. But he ſayes, [<hi>when</hi> Superſtitioſus <hi>is uſed in an ill ſenſe, as when we ſay, a Superſtitious perſon, it's clear, that Superſtition there ſignifies Heathen worſhip; or worſhipping of others beſide the one true God, &amp;c.</hi>] That's not true; for the worſhipping of the <hi>true God,</hi> in an <hi>undue</hi> and <hi>unlawful</hi> manner, is by the <hi>School-man,</hi> and by moſt <hi>Divines,</hi> yea, the Doctor himſelf, <hi>p.</hi> 24. <hi>n.</hi> 12. called <hi>Superſtition.</hi> And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other <hi>kindes</hi> of <hi>Superſtition</hi> the Doctor hath acknowledged, (as appears in theſe <hi>conceſſions</hi> we are now upon) which cannot ſignifie <hi>Heathen wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> that is, worſhipping of others beſide the one true God: as we ſhall ſhew in thoſe <hi>conceſſions</hi> that follow. It's true indeed, that he that is Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>[acts like one of thoſe falſe worſhippers, and agrees with them in ſome eminent branch of their falſe worſhip.]</hi> As <hi>Papiſts</hi> worſhipping <hi>Angels, Images, Bread, &amp;c.</hi> act like <hi>Heathens:</hi> but they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170718:23"/>are <hi>Superſtitious</hi> in many other things, that <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> were never guilty of; this therefore was but an <hi>evaſion,</hi> to take away the ſuſpicion of <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition</hi> from himſelf and his party, by laying it upon others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Angel-worſhip</hi> is an <hi>exceſs,</hi> and by the Doctor called that crime <hi>of Superſtition.</hi> But (ſayes he) <hi>[is this an exceſs of Religion, or not rather impiety?]</hi> Might not a man wonder at this queſtion?

                  <hi>['Tis true, (ſayes he) this is an addition to the object of worſhip;]</hi> But is not an <hi>Addition</hi> to the object of worſhip, an Addition to the <hi>Rule</hi> of worſhip; <hi>[God alone is to be worſhipped?]</hi> Yes, (ſayes he again) [<hi>As death is an adition to life,</hi> i.e. <hi>deſtruction to the oneneſs of that, and as adultery is an addition to marital love and fidelity.</hi>] What, <hi>juſt ſo,</hi> and no otherwiſe?

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170718:29"/>I can ſay no more, but that the firſt verſe of Geneſis, or any other in the Bible, hath as much of this to my eye, as the ſecond Commandment.]</hi> What a vaſt <hi>difference</hi> there is between an <hi>eye</hi> calm and <hi>clear,</hi> and the ſame eye overdrawn with a <hi>cataract</hi> of prejudice.

               <p>The Doctor hath ſpied, by his <hi>Optick glaſs,</hi> ſomething more, then other men do or can ſee, the <hi>cauſe of my miſtake</hi> in this matter: <hi>[It is,</hi>

                  <hi>the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn practiſe of ſome Caſuiſts, to reduce all ſins in the world, to ſome or other of the Commandments of the Decalogue; wherin I am not ſure, that they have aim'd aright, &amp;c.]</hi> Truly, I muſt profeſs, that I have believed, ſince I knew the Commandments, and what ſin is, that <hi>all ſins</hi> are <hi>reducible</hi> to ſome or other of the Commandments of the <hi>Decalogue.</hi> Sin (ſayes Saint <hi>John</hi>) is the tranſgreſſion of the Law: which the Doctor calls an <hi>univerſal Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime</hi> above; and if it be not ſome way a <hi>tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of that law, it is no ſin. So here's another <hi>contradiction, in adjecto,</hi> to ſay, a thing is a ſin, and no tranſgreſſion of the Law. Herein the Doctor is ſingular again; and runs groſs to all Divines, that I know of; but not without a ſhew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; <hi>[For ſeparate gluttony and drunkenneſs (as they may, and yet be ſins) from ſome accidentall</hi> conſequences <hi>of them—and you will hardly tell, whether to reduce the Intemperate uſe of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.]</hi> This is pretry <hi>untempered mortar;</hi> for, firſt, thoſe ſins of <hi>gluttony</hi> and <hi>drunkenneſs,</hi> cannot be ſeparated from ſome <hi>accidental</hi> ill conſequences or other (waſting of health is but one of them.) Yet he ſayes they may. 2. It is an old Rule, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting the Commandments; <hi>[That where any ſin is forbidden, all the cauſes, effects, degrees, &amp;c.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170718:30"/>are forbidden with it.]</hi> But the Doctor regards no ſuch <hi>old Rules.</hi> 3. Though it be <hi>hard,</hi> to which Commandment, directly to <hi>reduce</hi> ſome ſins, yet it's poſſible; and <hi>eaſie [upon the former Rule]</hi> to reduce ſome ſins to many Commandments. As: ergo, <hi>drunkenneſs</hi> and <hi>gluttony;</hi> as they are <hi>means</hi> to <hi>ſelf-murther,</hi> and murther of others ſometimes, are reducible to the ſixth Commandment. As <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives</hi> of luſt, to the ſeventh. As waſters of a mans eſtate, to the eighth. And ſome ſay, The <hi>Intemperate uſe</hi> of the Creatures, is reducible to the third Commandment, a taking of Gods Name in vain, which is much manifeſted by every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But I believe the Doctor will laugh at ſuch old Divinity; and were it not for the ill conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof, would eaſily make them no ſins, <hi>exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> them out of the <hi>Decalogue;</hi> which would be a <hi>brave doctrine</hi> to gratifie the <hi>Ranters.</hi> If the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor cannot (or but hardly) tell, to what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the <hi>Decalogue</hi> to reduce thoſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperances,</hi> they will eaſily believe and <hi>plead</hi> they are no ſins. But the Doctor ſhall be no <hi>Catechiſt,</hi> no <hi>Caſuist,</hi> or <hi>Confeſſor</hi> of mine, that holds any thing a ſin, not forbidden by the Law; and ſo is unable to reſolve me, againſt which Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the <hi>Intemperate uſe</hi> of the Creature offends. I have heard ſome, of no mean pretence to <hi>Piety,</hi> excuſe ſome of their party, that have been drunk; <hi>[They have but taken a little too much of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.]</hi> I wonder not, the Doctor is ſo <hi>favorable</hi> to the <hi>Riotous part</hi> of his Feſtival; when thus he gloſſes of ſins, and Commandments. But he gives another inſtance; <hi>[That ſort of lying, or falſe ſpeaking, which is no way hurtful, or no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be hurtful to the neighbor.]</hi> He means the <hi>jeaſting lye;</hi> to which he might have added, the <hi>officious lye,</hi> which is <hi>helpful</hi> to the neighbor,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170718:30"/>without <hi>hurting</hi> any man. If no body be hurt by theſe, the <hi>truth</hi> it ſelf is hurt; and that will be <hi>hurtful</hi> to the ſpeaker, what ever it be to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor. There are many more of theſe inſtances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and by <hi>Papiſts</hi> are called but <hi>Venial ſins:</hi> with whom how near he <hi>complies</hi> in theſe caſes, let him conſider.</p>
               <p>Here again,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 36. <hi>n.</hi> 12.</note> the Doctor ſpeaks of the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and uncommanded worſhip to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; as if they were both equally, by us, judged unlawful: But in ſtead of rectifying a miſtake, he makes one: <hi>[He hath not conſidered this one thing, that whatſoever is not forbidden, is lawful: not, whatſoever is not commanded is unlawful.]</hi> Theſe words, if referred to Circumſtances, are both wayes true; but referred to worſhip, both wayes falſe: whatſoever Circumſtance of worſhip is not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is lawful: but whatſoever worſhip is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, is unlawful; as was ſaid above; <hi>ad p.</hi> 33. <hi>n.</hi> 7. And then <hi>uncommanded</hi> worſhip, if it be a ſin and unlawful, being forbidden by ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and all the other nine renouncing it, it muſt (but without <hi>crowding</hi>) be reduced to the ſecond Commandment, or to none. My anſwer therefore is ready to his queſtions; 1. That many,

They that have referred it thither have given as cogent reaſons for it, as the Doctor himſelf hath done, when he <hi>gloſſed</hi> the ſenſe of <hi>the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi> to be this, <hi>[That God muſt be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in a manner peculiar to him, and appointed by him.]</hi> Whence it may be argued and concluded that <hi>worſhip not appointed,</hi> that is, not commanded by him, is <hi>forbidden,</hi> by the ſecond Commandment.</p>

                  <hi>[That all Additions to the Rule of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip are not Superſtition.]</hi> But I ſay all uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>worſhip,</hi> is an <hi>Addition</hi> to the Rule of worſhip, and ſo <hi>Superſtition,</hi> and ſinful.

I would but propound this argument; [<hi>To uſe the Name of God, unreverently, was ever a Sin, againſt ſome moral Law; but to uſe the Name of God fooliſhly, wantonly, (much more, profanely, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly) is to uſe the Name of God, unreverently, and vainly:</hi> ergo,] If againſt a <hi>Moral-law,</hi> I ask again, Againſt which <hi>Commandment,</hi> if not againſt the third? To ſhut up this: the Doctor ſayes, <hi>Pract. Cat. p.</hi> 121. <hi>[Swearing by other inferior things, are now utterly unlawful:]</hi> What now onely? were they not ſo, in the Old-law? It ſeemes not, by the Doctor; for he ſayes, this is ſomething, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath added to <hi>perfect</hi> the Law; [<hi>A Chriſtian muſt not uſe any of thoſe</hi> Oaths.] Belike a <hi>Jew</hi> might: But why not a Chriſtian now?

Why might not the Doctor have given this reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a <hi>taking of Gods Name in vain,</hi> (which is much made <hi>known</hi> by the Creatures) and againſt the <hi>Commandment,</hi> which requires, that when men do ſwear, they <hi>ſwear</hi> onely by his <hi>Name.</hi> But theſe would have marred his <hi>new gloſs.</hi> I leave it to him.</p>

                  <hi>[to perſwade (that aſſertion afore) he commends one obſervation to us, but ſuch, as I think, never ſlipt from any man before him.]</hi> Surely the Doctor hath met with ſome <hi>Errata</hi>'s, in ſome <hi>Authors</hi> Printed, which are as <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> or as much <hi>non-ſenſe,</hi> as theſe of mine are.

The <hi>School-man</hi> makes Worſhip of God <hi>Illegitimate,</hi> as well by the <hi>pravity,</hi> as the <hi>ſuperfluity</hi> of it: How may that be? Two wayes, one whereof is (which the Doctor takes notice of.) <hi>That the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters publike uſing any Ceremony, contrary to the cuſtome of the Church (ſuch is his ſitting at the Sacrament, and the like) is a pravity, and that's worſe then a ſuperfluity in the Worſhip of God.</hi>] Here is <hi>ſcarce any minute part of ſound Doctrine,</hi> in this, (to return him his own words.) For, firſt,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170718:49"/>It ſavours rankly of the <hi>Romiſh uſurpation,</hi> that no <hi>Ceremony</hi> may be uſed publickly by a <hi>Minister</hi> contrary to the <hi>Cuſtome</hi> of the Church: ſecond, That it is a pravity, ſo to do; which may rather go for a Superfluity at moſt. 3. That it is a <hi>pravity,</hi> worſe then <hi>ſuperfluity</hi> of Worſhip, to uſe a <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> in publique; whereas <hi>Super-added Worſhip,</hi> is far worſe, then uſing a <hi>new Ceremony,</hi> not ordained by the <hi>Church:</hi> 4. That he charges this <hi>pravity</hi> upon me, or others for ſitting at the Sacrament; But, firſt, we are ſpeaking of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> not of a rite or <hi>geſture</hi> of Worſhip, ſuch is <hi>ſitting</hi> at the Sacrament. 2. How does he know, that I <hi>ſit</hi> at the Sacrament? I may perhaps ſtand, or kneel, for ought he knows, according to the <hi>cuſtome</hi> of the places where I come; and may defend my practiſe, by the Authority of Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> cited to me, <hi>p.</hi> 232. But thirdly, ſuppoſe I do ſit; I ſhall not fear to <hi>profeſs</hi> my Judgement, that I think it neerer to the firſt <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of the Supper, then his <hi>kneeling;</hi> and why people ſhould not <hi>conform</hi> rather to <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, then to the <hi>cuſtome</hi> of a Church, I know no reaſon, but, <hi>[The Statutes of Omri are kept,]</hi> and the like. But this I will ſay, if the Doctor or his <hi>Church,</hi> inſtitute and command <hi>kneeling,</hi> as a ſpecial, <hi>more ſpecial</hi> and better Worſhip of God, then <hi>ſitting,</hi> I believe, they would be <hi>Superstitious</hi> enough; and injurious to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as preferring themſelves before him, as if he were <hi>leſs humble,</hi> or leſs devout in his <hi>ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> then they in their <hi>kneeling,</hi> And now I hope, the Doctor will never cite <hi>Aquinas</hi> more, in this matter.</p>

                  <hi>Greek</hi> Church, as much? And I retort it upon the Doctor. If the <hi>Judges</hi> of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> for <hi>number</hi> and <hi>wholeſomneſs,</hi> have ſuch large unqueſtionable <hi>Authority, [to appoint
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170718:62"/>what Ceremonies, they ſhall judge moſt uſeful, moſt for edification, and most agreeable to the analogy of faith.</hi>] (As he aſſerts, they have, of <hi>Feſt. ſ.</hi> 9.) Then, the <hi>Judges</hi> of the next age, having the very <hi>ſame power,</hi> with their <hi>predeceſſors,</hi> may add as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, (and the next after them as many more) as they ſhall think <hi>uſeful</hi> to thoſe ends; till they have made the <hi>number</hi> great, and <hi>burthen</hi> intollerable. This <hi>conſequence</hi> is unavoidable, upon his <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi> It therefore concerns him (as well as me) to <hi>expedite</hi> himſelf out of this ſnare: How ſhall this be done, to free us both? I conceive one of theſe wayes; 1. That the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> reaches onely to <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of Worſhip, reſpecting <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and <hi>Decency;</hi> and then, as any <hi>Wiſe-man</hi> can eaſily determine them, by the <hi>Light</hi> of Reaſon, as <hi>Time, Place, Geſture</hi> in Worſhip; ſo they will be very <hi>Few,</hi> and cannot well be <hi>Multiplied,</hi> being the ſame or like, in all ages of the Church. And this I think, is moſt <hi>ſuitable</hi> to the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel</hi> Worſhip. 2. Or elſe, that if the <hi>Church</hi> take upon her, to appoint <hi>new Ceremonies,</hi> above what the Scripture holds out, ſhe makes them <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip; (as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> does all her <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and ſome did ſome of ours) which is <hi>unlawful.</hi> And this was the opinion of thoſe who <hi>abstained</hi> from our <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> that they were made <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip, and therefore unlawful. Theſe things ſatisfie me; If they do not <hi>pleaſe</hi> the Doctor, let him take his own way to <hi>expedite</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Sure if he were but conſtant to himſelf, and did not confound <hi>Circumſtances</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> putting one for another, as if they were the ſame; he might remember, what he ſaid afore; <hi>[That ſome Rites and Circumſtances of time, place and gesture, are abſolutely neceſſary to Religion;]</hi> That was his concluſion. <hi>pag.</hi> 7. <hi>n.</hi> 5.

I could eaſily name the man, that is <hi>ſuperſtitious,</hi> in <hi>defending</hi> and <hi>practiſing</hi> uncommanded Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but ſhall reſerve that, till a fitter time.

If they may, then men may be Judges, what Ceremonies are fit, for number and wholeſomneſs, which is contrary to the words of the Diatribiſt.]</hi> But I demand of him, if this be not a very <hi>Sophiſme?</hi> For firſt, will he ſay, <hi>bowing at the Name of Jeſus,</hi> is a <hi>new Worſhip,</hi> or onely a new <hi>Circumstance</hi> of Worſhip; if the latter, it's beſide the queſtion, and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call'd a <hi>Ceremony.</hi> 2. Will he ſay, that any thing, in it ſelf <hi>Indifferent</hi> may be brought into the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God? hath the <hi>Church</hi> ſuch a power, to <hi>inſtitute</hi> Ceremonies, of what is ſo indifferent? will not this make them <hi>quickly</hi> to be <hi>many,</hi> to be burdenſome, and bring <hi>confuſion</hi> into the Church? <hi>ergo,</hi> It's indifferent (he ſays) to bow, at the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> may the <hi>Church</hi> of this age command men to bow in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, when, &amp; as often as all theſe three are named? If ſo; the name of God, <hi>Jehovah, Lord, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi> and all his <hi>Attributes,</hi> are in themſelves Indifferent to be bowed at, when they are named. May not the <hi>Church</hi> of this, or the next age, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170718:63"/>her members to bow, when any or all theſe are named? what <hi>confuſion</hi> would this breed? yet ſo ſhe may, by the Doctors arguing. If ſhe may not <hi>multiply</hi> Ceremonies of that kind, <hi>[then it ſeemes</hi> (his words) <hi>what was before lawful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, is now ſince it was commanded, and by no other change, become unlawful:]</hi> Let him try, how he will eſcape.</p>
               <p>I had ſaid, they <hi>abſtained,</hi> becauſe they were thought not <hi>indifferent,</hi> but obtruded on them as <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 30. <hi>n.</hi> 8.</note> 
                  <hi>[Theſe words are either a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnie againſt the Governors of the Church, or elſe they aſſert what he diſclaims ſo ſolemnly.]</hi> Neither of theſe is true; 1.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>n.</hi> 9.</note> Not a <hi>calumy</hi> againſt the the Church, <hi>[as if they thought the Ceremonies ſimply neceſſary, by Divine Law, though ſhe had not commanded them.]</hi> This is none of my meaning (whatever ſome might think) but becauſe the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſers,</hi> thought they were <hi>ſo obtruded,</hi> or being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded, were by themſelves thought to be not <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi> but <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip. Suppoſe they did erre, in ſo thinking; yet they did not <hi>abſtain</hi> meerly becauſe they were commanded (which is the Doctors <hi>calumny)</hi> by lawful Authority; they rather thought the <hi>Authority</hi> unlawful, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded on them things perhaps <hi>indifferent,</hi> as <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip. 2. Nor do I mean, that being in themſelves <hi>indifferent,</hi> they became <hi>neceſſary,</hi> by the Churches command; and ſo made <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip, as that may poſſibly ſignifie parts of <hi>obedience,</hi> to Superiors, by Gods command: For neither do I ever call that <hi>obedience</hi> to Superiors, in the ſecond Table a <hi>part</hi> of Worſhip, nor ever ſay, that the <hi>Churches</hi> command, can truly make them ſo, and <hi>neceſſary:</hi> But I meant (as before) they that <hi>abſtained,</hi> did it upon this ground, becauſe they thought them to be made <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip, and ſo
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170718:64"/>not, upon his, becauſe they were <hi>commanded</hi> by Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>n.</hi> 11.</note> And that I may take in the next; <hi>[be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe uſed and abuſed by Papiſts, and by them made parts of Worſhip:]</hi> It's evident that <hi>Papists</hi> do make all or moſt of their <hi>Ceremonies parts</hi> of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; Hear what favor he ſhews to <hi>Papiſts</hi> that he may lave himſelf from guilt: <hi>[Truly I cannot with truth thus affirm of the Papiſts, that any of the Ceremonies which we uſe from them, were ever by them accounted parts of Worſhip, but onely as vſeful wholeſome Ceremonies appointed by the Church.]</hi> Cannot he ſay this of them, when he knows, they <hi>place the Worſhip</hi> of God in them? Are not their <hi>Holy-days</hi> made and accounted <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip? Is not <hi>Caelibate,</hi> and <hi>vowed Virginity, Poverty, &amp;c.</hi> made a <hi>part</hi> of Worſhip? Is not the <hi>croſs</hi> in <hi>Baptiſme</hi> ſo eſteemed by them? Truly if the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do not make thoſe <hi>Ceremonies parts</hi> of Worſhip; our men (that have <hi>borrowed</hi> them from them) are the more to <hi>blame,</hi> who (what ever they ſay againſt it) do <hi>practically</hi> make and obſerve ſome of them as <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip, well nigh <hi>as much,</hi> as thoſe that were inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as ſhall appear hereafter.</p>
               <p>Hence, the Doctors <hi>Apology</hi> for himſelf, by <hi>miſcenſuring</hi> of me, is the more blameable; <hi>[That all his skill lies in mannaging that one fallacy; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all Ceremonies and inſtitutions of the Church, under that one ambiguous phraſe of uncommanded Worſhip, perſwading himſelf, or others, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce new parts of Worſhip.]</hi> I know no <hi>fallacy</hi> here at all; For that it is <hi>untrue,</hi> that I put all <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi> under that <hi>ambiguous</hi> phraſe, appears, by my <hi>profeſſion</hi> often, and one newly cited here; from my 28. <hi>ſect. [Some Rites and Ceremonies of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, are rather called Circumſtances of Worſhip, time, place, geſture, which are common Adjuncts
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170718:64"/>of religious and civil affairs, then parts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.]</hi> Where it's evident, both that I take <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> onely for <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of Worſhip, and alſo oppoſe them, to <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip. And the Doctor himſelf hath as fully and plainly profeſſed againſt all <hi>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170718:74"/>diſtinguiſh Juſtice, (his preſent inſtance) thus, Juſtice is either, 1. The Moral vertue it ſelf. 2. Or ſome act thereof. 3.

So the Acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the degrees thereof, &amp;c. are either the ſame kinde of Worſhip, or but accidental differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſame Worſhip. 2. In his diſtinction of Worſhip, againſt Ceremonies and Circumſtances, he is no leſſe confuſed. For 1. <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</hi> of Worſhip, are not one and the ſame, (which yet he ſeemes to make them) as was ſaid above. 2. <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and Circumſtances, were ſometimes <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip (and ſo Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Ceremonial) as the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and <hi>Temple,</hi> time and place, after mentioned, in his Illuſtration, by Juſtice, &amp;c. And <hi>Ceremonies</hi> however, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken for <hi>external Worſhip,</hi> (as I ſaid above;) and then he ſhould have diſtinguiſhed Worſhip, thus: Worſhip is either Moral and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, or Ceremonial and Accidental; and then his Ceremonies had been, not onely <hi>parts,</hi> but <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of Worſhip: And ſuch indeed he makes them, however he diſſemble the matter here. But who is the wiſer by all this confuſion? who can tell, for he tells us not) what is meant by Worſhip in the word, <hi>Will-worſhip:</hi> It muſt be, either the vertue or ſome act, or degree, or frequencie of it, on the one ſide; or a Circumſtance, no part, but acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of Worſhip, which of them I know not.

He ſhould have told us, whether thoſe may, in any propriety, be called Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; as Ceremonies in Religion, are by ſome cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and made Worſhip. 2. He ſhould now apply this diſtinction and illuſtration, and tell us, what now he meanes by Worſhip; whether the vertue, or ſome Act, or degree &amp; frequency of it, or the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, that is the circumſtances of time and place: if he mean the latter onely, Circumſtances of time and place; as it is not comprehended in the word VVill-worſhip, ſo it is not controverted between us: as hath oft been ſaid in the other Tract.

The beſt <hi>Commentators</hi> on this place, never dream'd of the <hi>Gnoſticks;</hi> but generally ſay, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> oppoſes himſelf againſt two <hi>Sects,</hi> then troubling the Church: Firſt, ſome <hi>Philoſophers</hi> turn'd <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who brought in <hi>Philoſophical ſpeculations;</hi> at theſe he ſtrikes, verſe 8. and 18. in Worſhip of Angels. Secondly, ſome <hi>Judaizing Chriſtians,</hi> who would keep up the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law with the Goſpel; againſt theſe are the 16.20, 21, 22. verſes. In particular, the 21 verſe hath clear reference to the <hi>Abſtinencies</hi> formerly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Jews, but now aboliſhed by Chriſt, Touch not, taſte not, &amp;c. as ſome ſay. However, there is little or no <hi>colour</hi> to bring in the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> here; who though they agreed with others, in <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining</hi> from ſuch meats and drinks, yet the chief <hi>poyſon</hi> of that Sect was, in abandoning and vilifying of <hi>Marriage,</hi> and in other abominable <hi>filthineſſes,</hi> for which they had not the leaſt pretence from the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170718:81"/>Jewes (with whom the Doctor ſayes they joyn'd) to <hi>abſtain</hi> from Marriage, that being never <hi>prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited</hi> to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as ſome meats and drinks were: yet the Doctor ſpeaks hereafter,

                  <hi>[If they placed worſhip in them, in this ſenſe, that they did or taught them as parts of Gods commanded worſhip, 'tis the very thing, I placed the danger in: If they delivered them as their own doctrines, they did not then place any part of Gods command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worſhip in them.]</hi> Enough hath been ſaid to this in the former <hi>Section:</hi> I onely ask, what makes the word <hi>(commanded)</hi> here?

               <p>WE have been very long upon the laſt Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we ſhall be eaſed by the ſhortneſs of this: The Doctor puts it off, as ſpoken to before; and ſo do I; onely I cannot but adde to what I ſaid before, theſe few things. 1. That the <hi>Doctor</hi> begs the queſtion, in this argument, if you will but grant him his <hi>good ſenſe</hi> of Will-worſhip (which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally denied) then this <hi>obſcure place</hi> may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently underſtood, which hath poſed ſo many. 2. The conſequence is nought; for grant him his good ſenſe, yet it followes not, that ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines are <hi>deſtructive</hi> onely, becauſe they <hi>obtrude</hi> them as <hi>Divine precepts</hi> in this place; for they are held out as <hi>doctrines</hi> and <hi>commands</hi> of men; and if not held out as <hi>precepts</hi> of God, but only as <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip, <hi>acceptable</hi> to him; the place may be as well and better underſtood. 3. Here he <hi>limits</hi> the text, to <hi>out-dated Judaical</hi> conſtitutions: but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes in this his <hi>account,</hi> he ſayes,

If <hi>Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> be ill when the Worſhip is <hi>forbidden</hi> and falſe; it muſt be ſo taken here, becauſe thoſe <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinences</hi> made Worſhip were ill. 3.

When he ſayes, <hi>[It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill, the voluntarineſs can infuſe no goodneſs into it,]</hi> it is <hi>dilute dictum;</hi> he ſhould have ſaid, the <hi>voluntarineſs infuſes much ill into it,</hi> (as after he ſayes.) 5. In the next words, <hi>[When the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is of it ſelf good, the uncommandedneſs cannot make it ill.]</hi> He ſpeaks as improperly; firſt, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing (which is falſe) that any Worſhip is good, which is not commanded. 2. That, were it granted good in it ſelf, the <hi>uncommandedneſs</hi> could not make it ill; whereas were it never ſo good (as the <hi>Ceremonial out-dated Worſhip</hi> was) yet the very uncommandedneſs of it, if made <hi>Worſhip</hi> by men, would certainly make it ill; as he will confeſs ere long. But I ſhall prove it thus, from himſelf: <hi>[All forbidden, or falſe Worſhip, is ill; but all uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Worſhip, (that is made Worſhip by the will of man) is forbidden and falſe;</hi> ergo, <hi>it is ill.]</hi> The <hi>major</hi> is his own <hi>conceſſion</hi> here; the <hi>minor</hi> is proved from his own <hi>Gloſs</hi> upon the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, <hi>[God muſt be worſhipped in a way, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him.]</hi> Then all <hi>Worſhip</hi> not <hi>appointed</hi> by him, is forbidden and falſe.</p>

Let not the Doctor now come and tell me, he means it not of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> but of <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</hi> of Worſhip; for he pleads hitherto for <hi>Will-worſhip, uncommanded</hi> Worſhip. Indeed, as aſhamed of this,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 151. <hi>n.</hi> 6.</note> he qualifies it, a little after, <hi>[Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip,</hi> i. e. <hi>a</hi> performance <hi>voluntarily taken up, without any command of God;]</hi> and thus he ſhifts and hides himſelf often hereafter. For, the word <hi>performance</hi> is too general, and may reach to civil things of the ſecond <hi>Table,</hi> left indifferent; but we ſpeak of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> which is more ſpecial; let him ſpeak out and ſay, <hi>[Will-worſhip is a Worſhip vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily taken up, without any command of God,]</hi> and then he ſpeaks like himſelf, that is, unlike to all <hi>Reformed Divines;</hi> if he will undertake to <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> ſuch <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> to be lawful.

                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:170718:115"/>of the Law; he conceived them to be <hi>[directly parallel to thoſe voluntary, or uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded oblations among the Jews.]</hi> And thence concluded as he thought, <hi>irrefragably, [That the uncommandedneſs of a few decent rites, or uſeful ſeaſons, ſet apart for the worſhip of God, could not upon that account, become unlawful, &amp;c.]</hi> I ſhould not be ſo <hi>Critical</hi> or <hi>Cenſorious</hi> to <hi>think</hi> and judge that the Doctor <hi>equivocates</hi> in thoſe words, <hi>[Set apart for the Worſhip of God,]</hi> which may have a double ſenſe. 1. That they are ſet apart, as <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> of God; (as the <hi>Temple</hi> was ſet apart, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for other <hi>worſhip,</hi> but as it <hi>ſelf,</hi> a <hi>part</hi> of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.) 2. That they were ſet apart, onely as <hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> for other Worſhip commanded, to be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> in: I ſhould not, I ſay ſo <hi>judge,</hi> but that I have and do obſerve, that he doth make his <hi>Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,</hi> more then <hi>circumstances,</hi> even <hi>parts</hi> of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: as I ſhall manifeſt hereafter, and now go on.</p>
               <p>Thus he ſayes for the <hi>parallel</hi> of theſe two, <hi>[If in any other reſpect there were difference betwixt them, yet he was ſure there was none in that; they were equally not commanded by God, and ſo ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from criminous, as well as the Free-will-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were; or both ſtand or fall under the ſame condemnation.]</hi> But this proceeds, upon a double <hi>falſe ſuppoſition.</hi> 1. That theſe <hi>Will worſhips</hi> of his, and thoſe <hi>Free will offerings</hi> were (as he ſaid) <hi>directly parallel:</hi> whereas it will appear, they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, not in <hi>ſome other</hi> things, (as he) but halt upon the <hi>main leg</hi> on which that <hi>parallel</hi> ſhould ſtand; as ſhall appear preſently. 2. That they agree in this, <hi>[that they are both equally not commanded by God.]</hi> Which will alſo appear to be falſe. For upon review of what I ſaid, in my former <hi>Tract. ſ.</hi> 29.

But <hi>n.</hi> 19. of this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, be plainly denies to make good the <hi>parallel</hi> in this, <hi>[as not obliged to it, that every Rite and Feſtival ſhall be a part of Gods Worſhip alſo,]</hi> as thoſe <hi>Free-will-offerings</hi> were. But ſay I, if they be <hi>directly parallel,</hi> then either the <hi>Free will offerings</hi> were <hi>rites,</hi> or <hi>ceremonies,</hi> or <hi>circumſtances</hi> of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as his <hi>Willworſhip,</hi> are now; or both muſt equally be <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip, to make them <hi>parallel.</hi> For it is no good arguing, to ſay, thoſe <hi>Free-will-offerings</hi> were <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip, allowed by God; <hi>ergo, Will worſhips</hi> now are lawful, and allowed by God: and if they were but <hi>rites</hi> and <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> of worſhip, then it would be more unfit to conclude, therefore <hi>Will worſhip</hi> is lawful now, becauſe the things are not <hi>parallel; circumſtances</hi> of Worſhip, and worſhip it ſelf, are very diſtant, and no concluding from one to another. But this is good, <hi>circumſtances</hi> of Worſhip might lawfully be <hi>appointed</hi> by the <hi>Church,</hi> then, ſo they may now; and worſhip <hi>deviſed</hi> by the will of man, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful then, ſo it is now; but his <hi>will-worſhip,</hi> is worſhip <hi>deviſed</hi> by men; <hi>ergo,</hi> as <hi>unlawful</hi> now as then. I ſhall therefore diſcover a double difference,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170718:116"/>between thoſe <hi>Free-will-offerings,</hi> and his <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> pleaded for. 1. Thoſe (he ſayes) were <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip; but theſe often denied to be ſuch; wherein the <hi>parallel</hi> ought eſpecially to hold; both of them ſhould be <hi>uncommanded</hi> Worſhip, not <hi>uncommanded rites,</hi> or <hi>circumſtances</hi> of Worſhip. But now it's proved a <hi>contradiction</hi> in adjecto, to talk of uncommanded lawful Worſhip; if it be <hi>Worſhip,</hi> it is commanded; nothing not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, is worſhip, that is, not <hi>true worſhip,</hi> but falſe. And yet (ſee the <hi>abſurdity</hi> of it) the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor having denied his <hi>rites</hi> and <hi>circumſtances, fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals, &amp;c.</hi> to be <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip, yet pleads for <hi>uncommanded Worſhip;</hi> let him <hi>reconcile</hi> it. If he ſhall ſay, the <hi>Free will offerings</hi> were <hi>uncommand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Worſhip, and yet lawful: ſo may his <hi>voluntary oblations</hi> be: I ſhall ſhew his <hi>errour</hi> by a ſecond difference between them. 2. Thoſe <hi>Free-will-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi> were not <hi>equally</hi> not <hi>commanded,</hi> as his <hi>Will-worſhips</hi> are. For they were <hi>commanded</hi> (which is more then allowed) in their <hi>kindes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  </note> being to be <hi>offered</hi> onely of things commanded; they were <hi>uncommanded</hi> onely in their <hi>degrees; ergo,</hi> the ſpeciall <hi>kindes</hi> of <hi>beaſts, fowles, &amp;c.</hi> which were to be <hi>offered</hi> were commanded or preſcribed by God himſelf, and ſo far <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip; but <hi>how oft,</hi> or <hi>how much,</hi> for <hi>frequency,</hi> or <hi>quantity,</hi> (above what was <hi>neceſſarily</hi> required) was to be <hi>offered,</hi> was left <hi>free;</hi> and ſo was the <hi>ſame wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> in degrees; but did not properly make a <hi>new part,</hi> or kinde of Worſhip: the <hi>choice</hi> of a <hi>ſheep</hi> or <hi>goat;</hi> of two <hi>ſheep</hi> or <hi>more,</hi> was not a <hi>new worſhip,</hi> but a new <hi>circumſtance</hi> or degree of worſhip. But now his <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> (intended in the text, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.23.) is neither <hi>commanded</hi> for the <hi>kinde,</hi> (but <hi>forbidden</hi> rather, becauſe it is not commanded by God,) nor yet is it any <hi>degree</hi> of worſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not in a <hi>Worſhip</hi> commanded; if no <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:170718:116"/>commanded, no degree of Worſhip; it muſt then be <hi>falſe-worſhip.</hi> 3. In that liberty of <hi>choice,</hi> God had reſpect to the <hi>abilities</hi> of men, in his <hi>commanded</hi> Worſhip; and as a <hi>Pigeon</hi> was <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted</hi> from the <hi>poor,</hi> ſo a <hi>bullock</hi> was <hi>expected</hi> from the <hi>rich,</hi> for a <hi>thank-offering;</hi> and ſo became a <hi>duty,</hi> and no <hi>uncommanded</hi> Worſhip: <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.10. The parallel whereunto, in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is that Text, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 16.2. as was ſaid in my other <hi>Tract.</hi> But his <hi>Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> never comes to be a <hi>duty,</hi> but continues ſtill to be <hi>uncommanded</hi> Worſhip, and ſo forbidden. I may therefore ſafely conclude againſt his <hi>parallel: [Free will offerings were commanded worſhip, but his Will-worſhip is uncommanded Worſhip: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the parallel is moſt imparallel.]</hi> That <hi>Free-will-offerings</hi> were <hi>commanded</hi> Worſhip, is proved afore, by this, that they are by the Doctor confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and aſſerted to be parts of worſhip; but every <hi>part</hi> of Worſhip was commanded. That his <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> is <hi>uncommanded</hi> worſhip: (<hi>men deviſed</hi> Worſhip) is all along held out by him, deſcribing <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi> by <hi>uncommanded Worſhip.</hi> His <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel</hi> then being broken in the main leg on which it ſhould ſtand, there need no more to be ſaid to his Section: But to clear the matter more, I ſhall attend to what he ſays, but very briefly.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>formality</hi> of a <hi>Free will offering,</hi>

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170718:117"/>Will-worſhip, though he do make it ſo. 2. There were ſome things not particularly commanded, where yet it was not free, to offer or not to offer; as when it was left <hi>free,</hi> to offer a <hi>ſheep</hi> or a <hi>goat;</hi> it was not <hi>free,</hi> not to offer one of them; but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to offer a <hi>ſheep</hi> or a <hi>goat.</hi> 3. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, where it was not particular for the kinde, was yet general or <hi>indefinite,</hi> with reſpect to the <hi>abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of the offerer, and ſo <hi>neceſſary,</hi> not arbitrary. The woman for her <hi>purification,</hi> if able, was to bring a <hi>Lamb;</hi> and it had been ſin for her to bring a <hi>Dove:</hi> And ſhe that was poor, as ſhe was tied by <hi>command</hi> for the kinde of her offering, a <hi>Pigeon,</hi> or a <hi>Turtle-dove;</hi> ſo ſhe was bound to offer one of them: (not free to offer nothing) and that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty was no <hi>part</hi> of Worſhip, as I ſaid in my other <hi>Tract.</hi> 4. In thoſe other <hi>Offerings,</hi> (above what was particularly commanded) there was a <hi>liberty</hi> to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, or not to offer, ſo many <hi>Lambs, Sheep, Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks:</hi> but as theſe were preſcribed for the kindes, ſo they were, as a <hi>due debt</hi> of <hi>thankfulneſs,</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the able, whom God had more <hi>proſpered;</hi> and were therefore left <hi>arbitrary,</hi> becauſe all men were not <hi>equally able,</hi> (and ſo not equally <hi>obliged</hi>) to offer. That which was no ſin, for the poor, was a ſin in the rich; and this was done by a <hi>Goſpel di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.8. <hi>To prove the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of your love.</hi>
                  </note> (even among the <hi>Jewes</hi>) to try the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity</hi> of their hearts. In this ſenſe, we may grant <hi>Free will offrings</hi> now, in the times of the Goſpel; that is, in <hi>degrees</hi> of commanded Worſhip; <hi>ergo, Prayer</hi> is <hi>Worſhip</hi> commanded in general; there is no <hi>particular</hi> command, how <hi>often</hi> in a day, a man ſhall pray, that depending upon a mans <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occaſions</hi> and <hi>opportunities;</hi> which when they happened, the <hi>frequency</hi> was under com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: but that frequency made not a new kinde of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170718:117"/>worſhip, but a degree of the ſame kind of Worſhip. And if any man ſhould make that <hi>frequency,</hi> or <hi>number,</hi> a <hi>part</hi> of Worſhip; he made a <hi>new kinde</hi> of Worſhip, which the Doctor himſelf condemns. Again, we may be ſaid to have <hi>Free will offerings</hi> in this ſenſe; as they had a <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>choice</hi> to offer a <hi>Sheep</hi> or a <hi>Goat, &amp;c.</hi> ſo we (at leaſt in private) have a liberty of choice, of ſeveral <hi>ordinances,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der command; <hi>ergo, Prayer, Reading, Singing</hi> of <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> are <hi>Worſhip</hi> under command; and its <hi>arbitrary,</hi> which of theſe we will chuſe to worſhip God withal, or in what <hi>order,</hi> or <hi>frequency;</hi> but then theſe are not <hi>new kindes</hi> of worſhip, but wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for <hi>kinde,</hi> under command; and in reſpect to that <hi>order</hi> choſen, no <hi>Worſhip</hi> at all, but <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> of worſhip. To his ſecond thing required to a <hi>Free will offering, [that it were offered to God, (and accepted by him,) &amp;c.]</hi> I have this to ſay, 1. That the bare <hi>offering</hi> to God, is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; for <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> offer their ſervices to God. 2. That the <hi>acceptance</hi> of it, depended upon the <hi>command</hi> of God, at leaſt for the <hi>kinde; [as being of thoſe kindes, (ſayes he) which are known to be allowed by him.]</hi> Where he ſayes too little; they were not onely <hi>allowed,</hi> but <hi>commanded</hi> by him for <hi>kinde,</hi> and therefore <hi>allowed,</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,</hi> becauſe they were commanded: if a man ſhould have offered a <hi>Lion</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Sheep</hi> or <hi>Bullock,</hi> or an <hi>Eagle</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Pigeon, &amp;c.</hi> this had been a <hi>new worſhip,</hi> and abominable: and this would be <hi>parallel</hi> to his <hi>will worſhips</hi> now, which are not <hi>degrees</hi> of commanded Worſhip, but <hi>new kindes</hi> or <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip. The <hi>Jews</hi> might offer <hi>Free will offerings,</hi> in commanded worſhip, above what was <hi>particularly</hi> commanded, but they might not <hi>deviſe</hi> or offer any <hi>new kindes</hi> of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: and now by what hath been ſaid, the Reader
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170718:118"/>may ſee the Doctors grand miſtake, <hi>[That his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanded Worſhip is directly parallel to thoſe Free will offerings,]</hi> which he again affirms here, <hi>n.</hi> 4. <hi>[Some things were left to mens free power and choice; if they offered, they ſhould be accepted, if not, they ſinned not; which is the perfect image and clear interpretation of that</hi>

He argued therefore imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently. [<hi>There were Free will offerings, which were part of Worſhip, then;</hi> ergo, <hi>he cannot ſee, but there may be ſomewhat of the ſame conſtitution now, voluntary and not particularly impoſed, yet allowed by, and acceptable to God.</hi>] He deludes us with generalities.

                  </gap>, in the text; and this (not as he ſtates it) is my <hi>Engine</hi> to <hi>demoliſh</hi> all that he ſaid, from that <hi>parallel;</hi> let him ſtay, and examine it, as long as he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>The Doctor now comes to <hi>ſtate</hi> the queſtion,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>n.</hi> 8.</note> 
                  <hi>[It muſt be of the ſpontaneouſneſs of the oblations, whether that being confeſſed lawful and acceptable under the Law, it be now unlawful under Chriſt, &amp;c.]</hi> But that's his <hi>grand miſtake;</hi> the queſtion is of the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>oblations.</hi> 1. That they be for <hi>kinde,</hi> under precept: and 2. That they be <hi>parts</hi> or degrees of commanded Worſhip: elſe, were they never ſo <hi>ſpontaneous,</hi> they were not <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable</hi> to God; the matter of any VVorſhip is then onely <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>acceptable,</hi> when it falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a command; that gives it the <hi>form,</hi> and makes it <hi>true</hi> VVorſhip. He <hi>equivocates</hi> with us, in, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanded oblations:</hi> which may be either, not at all commanded by God, in their <hi>kindes,</hi> and for ſuch he will not plead; for that is to introduce <hi>new worſhip:</hi> or if commanded in the kinde, yet not in the particular degree, or circumſtances, and that will do him no good; for that is not <hi>will-worſhip,</hi> deviſed by men; ſuch as that <hi>will-worſhip</hi> he pleads for muſt be: but as it is worſhip for <hi>kinde</hi> commanded, ſo it may, <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> (as they ſpeak) be neceſſary, which his <hi>will-worſhip</hi> cannot be. Two things I ſhall adde to this number, 1. That he calls his <hi>will-worſhip, Oblations;</hi> which were in the old Law, <hi>parts</hi> of VVorſhip, or <hi>proper</hi> VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: which he will anon deny of his. 2. That if <hi>ſpontaneouſneſs</hi> of <hi>oblations</hi> alone, will make them lawful and <hi>acceptable</hi> to God, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are as <hi>ſpontaneous,</hi> and voluntary in their vowed <hi>Caeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, Poverty,</hi> ſuch and ſuch <hi>Habits, Faſtings, &amp;c.</hi> as the Doctor can be in his <hi>will-worſhip;</hi> and ſo he

               <p>And now I ſhall come to conſider his arguments; the firſt whereof is (he ſayes,

[1. <hi>They were thus of force againſt all uncommanded ſervices, in the old Teſtament.</hi> 2. <hi>by Analogie they ſtill hold under the New, which if they do, then is this the direct contradictory to both the Diatribiſts preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, &amp;c.</hi>] His argument is thus ſumm'd up: [<hi>Whatſoever was lawful under the Old Teſtament,</hi>

                     <hi>p.</hi> 177. <hi>n.</hi> 12</note> 
                  <hi>is lawful under the New. But Free-will or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanded offerings were lawful under the Old Teſtament;</hi> ergo.] Firſt his <hi>Major</hi> is none of mine, and clearly falſe; none of mine, for I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued (with learned <hi>Divines</hi>) clean contrary; <hi>[The worſhip of God then, was far different from the worſhip of the Goſpel;]</hi> And as he ſets it, it is clearly <hi>falſe,</hi> and he can never prove it, <hi>[That whatſoever (worſhip, for of that we ſpeak) was lawful then, is lawful now.]</hi> Give me leave to make an <hi>aſſumption</hi> to it from himſelf, <hi>n.</hi> 7. [<hi>The kinde of that worſhip was Levitical; and long ſince aboliſhed by Chriſt,</hi> yet was lawful then. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the former diſtinction of <hi>uncommanded worſhip,</hi> will avoid his whole argument: <hi>uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> for <hi>kinde,</hi> or <hi>uncommanded</hi> for <hi>degree</hi> or circumſtances: In the firſt <hi>ſenſe,</hi> (as I meant it) the Texts by me alledged do directly <hi>militate</hi> in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> But then the <hi>Minor</hi> is falſe; <hi>uncommanded offerings</hi> for <hi>kinde,</hi> were not lawful under the old Teſtament: if <hi>uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> be taken, in the ſecond <hi>ſenſe,</hi> uncommand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>degrees,</hi> or frequency, &amp;c. which are but
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170718:119"/>
                  <hi>circumſtances</hi> of Worſhip commanded, they were lawful then. But this will not ſerve his turn; who pleads for <hi>uncommanded, will-deviſed Worſhip,</hi> both for <hi>kindes</hi> and <hi>circumſtances:</hi> ſuch are his <hi>Will-worſhips,</hi> of <hi>Virginity, &amp;c.</hi> not at all commanded by God, but left <hi>indifferent,</hi> as he confeſſes. Now the argument may (in my ſenſe) be retorted; [<hi>What ever (worſhip) was unlawful in the Old Teſtament is unlawful in the New. But uncommanded offerings (for kinde) were unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then;</hi> ergo, <hi>ſo now.</hi>] Let him try his ſtrength to anſwer this. But there is one <hi>foul miſtake, n.</hi> 10. (whether willingly or no, I will not ſay.) In touching upon my argument from the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, (in the particular of <hi>Feſtivals</hi>) he charges me to ſay, [<hi>It is an offence in the exceſs, to obſerve any other</hi> Holy-day, <hi>but that one of the weekly Sabbath.</hi>] My words are otherwiſe, [<hi>To make and obſerve other days, as</hi> Holy <hi>as the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sabbath, as parts of Worſhip, is an offence and exceſs againſt the fourth Commandment.</hi>]</p>
               <p>The ſame diſtinction (as afore) will cut the <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news</hi> of his next argument,

               <p>To the third argument, little need be ſaid more: <hi>Free-will offerings</hi> were then lawful,

As for the fourth argument;
<note place="margin">

I named the two firſt, but inſiſted chiefly on the laſt. <hi>[It was not any</hi> part <hi>of VVorſhip, but a Circumſtance of VVorſhip,</hi>] and ſo nothing to the preſent buſineſs; which is of <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>worſhip,</hi> ſuch as thoſe <hi>Free-will-offerings</hi> were aſſerted to be: the <hi>Temple</hi> or houſe which <hi>David</hi> was intended to build, was not to be a <hi>part</hi> of worſhip, or a place made by him, <hi>more Holy</hi> than other places; but (as I ſaid) by <hi>accident,</hi> as it ſerves for the <hi>commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,</hi> and convenience of the worſhippers, and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced, in our <hi>Churches</hi> now. For they uſed to ſay, [Time <hi>and</hi> Place, <hi>are equal circumſtances of</hi> Worſhip, <hi>and both equally Holy, or not Holy:</hi>] But he warily waves it, onely ſaying, <hi>num.</hi> 8. <hi>[So is a Feſtival now, a time, as that (Temple) a place, and ſo equally a circumſtance of worſhip.]</hi> Yet ſurely <hi>Time,</hi> that is, his <hi>Feſtival,</hi> is made more then a <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,</hi> even a <hi>part</hi> of VVorſhip, <hi>more Holy, &amp;c.</hi> as will appear hereafter; and I ſuppoſe, he hath the ſame opinion of ſome <hi>places,</hi> our conſecrated <hi>Churches,</hi> though now he call them both, but <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</hi> of VVorſhip. But to the point of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> intention; it was either <hi>abſolute,</hi> or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional; if <hi>conditional,</hi> that he would build an houſe,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170718:122"/>if God ſhould <hi>allow,</hi> and warrant the buſineſs, ſo far it was commendable; but if it was <hi>abſolute, Divines</hi> do not fear to ſay, it was unlawful; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> might neither build, nor ſet out a <hi>place</hi> for the <hi>Temple,</hi> without Gods <hi>direction,</hi> and leave. And its moſt probable, that his intention was <hi>abſolute,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.5, 7.</note> and therefore he is in a manner <hi>checked</hi> for it by God, though his <hi>intention</hi> to do ſomething for God, was by <hi>Indulgence</hi> accepted. And then, this example will afford no force for inſtituting <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ceremonies</hi> by men: which the Doctor calls, <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi> or <hi>Free-will-offerings.</hi> If they will ſay, they intend them <hi>conditionally,</hi> if God will <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> them, let them produce that <hi>warrant,</hi> and we are ſatisfied: warrant, I ſay, not for <hi>circumſtances</hi> of Worſhip, (which is yeilded) but for their <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi> uncommanded Worſhip. Before then that this inſtance will ſerve the Doctors turn, he muſt prove theſe things, firſt, That this <hi>Free-will-offering</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> was a part of Worſhip; for ſo they are aſſerted to be under the Law, and yet he will not be <hi>obliged</hi> to make good the <hi>parallel</hi> ſo far, for his Rites and Feſtivals. <hi>p.</hi> 186. <hi>n.</hi> 19.2.

That it was commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and accepted by God; as it was <hi>abſolutely</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by him.

If <hi>Nathan</hi> failed in his allowance of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> purpoſe, (as it's evident he did) then <hi>David</hi> alſo failed, in his too <hi>abſolute</hi> purpoſe, which God after diſallows. And thence we may raiſe this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>[It was not lawful for</hi> David <hi>to purpoſe abſolutely the building any Religious houſe for
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170718:123"/>Gods Ark, without Gods ſpecial command, or warrant, therefore it is not lawful for men to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute Religious Ceremonies, without the ſame warrant.]</hi> I ſtill ſay a <hi>Religious Houſe,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Ceremonies,</hi> which are thereby put into a <hi>ſtate of Religion,</hi> and ſo <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip; which meer <hi>circumstances</hi> are not: and ſuch the Doctor ſays, he makes <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place;</hi> but indeed makes them <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip, as we have often ſaid.

A good man, a Chriſtian, is <hi>merciful</hi> to his beaſt, is that alſo an act of Worſhip? 3. Is the work of <hi>mercy,</hi> Matth. 6.7. an act of Worſhip, becauſe it is ſet in the <hi>front</hi> of ſuch? why, he knows, that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> deny <hi>Faſting,</hi> which is one of them, to be a <hi>part</hi> of Worſhip, but an <hi>help</hi> or <hi>circumſtance</hi> of worſhip: yet that is nearer to worſhip, then works of mercy. 4. <hi>Appointed</hi> to be <hi>exerciſed on the Lords</hi> day; but is it not a <hi>work</hi> of any day, as well. 5. Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> but ſure not properly, but alluſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as an <hi>imperate</hi> act of Piety, not <hi>elicite;</hi> as was ſaid above: what's this, but a <hi>Chaos</hi> of <hi>confuſion,</hi> to jumble the two Tables together, <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> 6. But <hi>[to remove all ſcruple, he wiſhes that after the cuſtome of the primitive Apoſtolick Church, this Alms be preſented to God in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and then as certainly, it will be a branch of Christian Worſhip; and his inſtance ſhall be ſet to that, &amp;c.]</hi> But this is as weak as the former; no act of <hi>Charity,</hi> when ever, or how ever done, can properly be a <hi>branch</hi> of Worſhip; unleſs he will confound the two <hi>Tables</hi> of the Law.

I hope all acts of <hi>mercy</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath, watering</hi> a beaſt, or <hi>pulling</hi> him out of a pit, yea, or <hi>viſiting</hi> the ſick, is not thereby made an act or <hi>branch</hi> of Worſhip; eſpecially when <hi>that

                  <hi>[The question is certainly this, whether ceremonies and feſtivals in a Church are criminous, if they be not commanded by God.]</hi> No, his <hi>conſcience</hi> can tell him, this is his grand and groſs miſtake; the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is of <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi> like to the <hi>Free-will-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi> which were <hi>parts</hi> or degrees of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Worſhip; which his <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Feſtivals</hi> are here again denied to be; and called <hi>circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> not <hi>acts</hi> of Worſhip. But his <hi>alms,</hi> were in the laſt number, made <hi>certainly branches</hi> of Worſhip: <hi>ſacrifices, acts</hi> of Worſhip. What interfeering is here? 2. <hi>[The reaſon is the ſame of circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and degrees; if then uncommanded degrees may be lawful, uncommanded circumſtances muſt be lawful alſo.]</hi> Still the former miſtake, that there is the ſame reaſon of <hi>circumſtances,</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of Worſhip; when as <hi>degrees</hi> of Worſhip (ſuch were thoſe <hi>Free-will-offerings</hi>) were <hi>Worſhip,</hi> acts, and branches of Worſhip; but ſo are not <hi>circumſtances.</hi> 3. The next is founded on the ſame miſtakes, that either <hi>alms</hi> is a <hi>branch</hi> of Worſhip, or that there is the ſame reaſon, for <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and for <hi>Charity,</hi> both which are denied and diſproved. 4. The ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer may ſerve to this; <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> are ill compared. But I adde, the degrees of <hi>alms,</hi> are generally commanded, with reſpect to mens <hi>abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and <hi>opportunities;</hi> but ſo are not his <hi>Will-worſhip.</hi> The <hi>utmoſt degree</hi> of mercy, in thoſe caſes, is not <hi>uncommanded,</hi> though it cannot eaſily be <hi>defined:</hi> for it muſt be reſolved, by <hi>abilities</hi> and neceſſities; which is not eaſie to determine, either <hi>how much</hi> I am bound to give, without <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> without <hi>exceſs;</hi> or what is the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170718:132"/>receiver of it; as I muſt give according to my <hi>abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> (wherein we are apt to <hi>deceive</hi> our ſelves) ſo I muſt not give to the <hi>prejudice</hi> of my ſelf, or <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,</hi> or others that need; which yet is ſometime done, for <hi>vain-glory,</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> to <hi>merit,</hi> by <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>The horns of his <hi>Dilemma</hi> are eaſily broken,

His <hi>Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi> for which he pleads, <hi>uncommanded</hi> Worſhip, are <hi>under</hi> no command, to be done, but under <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,</hi> not to be done. 2. I think, there is no <hi>high degree</hi> of mercy, not the higheſt, that he will pitch on, but it is commanded, in caſes aforeſaid, the <hi>mercy</hi> it ſelf is under a ſpecial command, the degree under a general. As God hath <hi>proſpered</hi> a man, as <hi>opportunity</hi> is offered, by <hi>neceſſities</hi> of the poor, &amp;c. But the Doctor is ſtill dreaming of <hi>acts of Piety and Charity,</hi>

                  </gap>, above any command; of which more ere long. 3. I ſaid, (by the Doctors grant) a man may offend in his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in <hi>exceſs,</hi> in <hi>defect;</hi> then there is a <hi>middle rule,</hi> which binds men from both the <hi>extremes:</hi> which reſolv'd on, makes it a <hi>debt,</hi> and ſo no <hi>Free-will-offering.</hi>

                     <hi>n.</hi> 9.</note> Then ſay I, he cannot ſet a <hi>proportion,</hi> exceeding that, which cannot be <hi>defined</hi> a duty: It cannot be done, but by <hi>particular</hi> circumſtances, which require great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and judgement. But ſayes he, <hi>[If that which is done, be more then that which we are bound to, it
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170718:132"/>cannot tranſgreſs in the defect.]</hi> So if we give <hi>leſs</hi> then we are bound to, it cannot tranſgreſs in the <hi>exceſs:</hi> yet both <hi>defect</hi> and <hi>exceſs,</hi> in vertues, are faulty. And I pray, If a man give <hi>more</hi> then he ought, is it not an <hi>exceſs?</hi> if leſs then he ought, is it not a <hi>defect?</hi> Did he not ſay, <hi>[It's poſſible, in Charity to offend both wayes?]</hi> But that cannot be, if it be <hi>impoſſible there ſhould be any exceſs,</hi> (as he expreſly ſays) in giving <hi>more</hi> then we are bound to. Is not <hi>Charity</hi> a <hi>Virtue,</hi> ſtanding in the <hi>midſt</hi> between two extreams? Then any deviction on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, is ſtrictly conſidered, ſinful. <hi>Peccare eſt tanquam tranſilere lineam,</hi> ſaid he: Yet (ſayes he) [<hi>There is an allowance in the New Teſtament of ſelling all, and giving to the poor,</hi> Acts 4.] He might as well have ſaid, there is a <hi>command</hi> of Chriſt himſelf, to the young man, <hi>To ſell all and give it to the poor;</hi> and a promiſe annexed. But then it had been a <hi>duty,</hi> and no <hi>Free-will-offering,</hi> which would not have fitted the Doctors deſign. Sure there was <hi>ſomething extraordinary</hi> in that <hi>Acts</hi> 4.

How gentle a <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> and eaſie a <hi>Caſuiſt</hi> would the Doctor be. If it be not eaſily <hi>known,</hi> when we <hi>ſin,</hi> (who can <hi>underſtand his errors?</hi>) we are exempted from <hi>duty,</hi> in obeying ſuch commands: ſuch as are ignorant, are not <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged</hi> by them. Becauſe we cannot do an act of <hi>vertue,</hi> without <hi>defect,</hi> or <hi>exceſs,</hi> does not the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> of God bind us, to avoid both? If <hi>ignorance</hi> would <hi>excuſe,</hi> men would <hi>affect</hi> it, to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from <hi>duty.</hi> But though it be hard, it's poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to find that <hi>middle</hi> point; <hi>Adam</hi> in innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie could finde it, (if he could as well have <hi>kept</hi> it) and our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> did both finde and keep it, and hath <hi>revealed</hi> enough for us to finde it, if we had but <hi>will</hi> or <hi>grace</hi> to ſeek it.

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170718:133"/>of allowance, though not of precept, &amp;c.]</hi> This cannot be true, in the <hi>rigor</hi> of the Law, of which we ſpeak, (for we ſpeak of things <hi>under,</hi> or not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> command.) The Law requires <hi>exact obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> to the <hi>middle</hi> point of perfection, and knows of no <hi>latitude</hi> of degrees, or of any <hi>allowance;</hi> but <hi>[do this and live, or not, and die.

And if (as here again it's ſaid) a man may be <hi>too parſimonious</hi> on the one ſide, or <hi>prodigal</hi> on the other, and go to far; both theſe are <hi>breaches</hi> of the rule.

But if of original ſin, this ſure will be found a miſtake; for this loſs of</hi> Adams <hi>was a puniſhment of</hi> Adams <hi>ſin, and in his posterity muſt be looked on as a puniſhment; and he that is puniſhed cannot be obliged not to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>] It's eaſily known, in what <hi>School,</hi> the Doctor learned this Divinity, though I ſay nothing. But to the point, and to begin with the laſt firſt. Firſt, What doth the Doctor mean by <hi>original ſin?</hi> That in <hi>Adam</hi> onely, or <hi>Adams</hi> firſt actual ſin? (as ſome <hi>Papiſts</hi> clearly do:) and ſo make the loſs of <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>original righteouſneſs,</hi> to be no ſin, but onely the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of ſin;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>If it were not ſin in</hi> Adam <hi>himſelf, then ſure it cannot he ſuch in his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? n.</hi> 3.</note> both in <hi>Adam,</hi> and in his <hi>poſterity?</hi> This <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ſeems to hold ſo, by his arguing; at leaſt in <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity. Yet why is it not a <hi>puniſhment</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi> as well as in his <hi>poſterity;</hi> and then no ſin in him, <hi>[for he that is puniſht cannot be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not to be puniſht.]</hi> If no man now be bound to be as <hi>prudent</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> was in his <hi>integrity,</hi> (as he ſays) was not <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf bound after his

Will the Doctor grant any <hi>original ſin</hi> in <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity? then I ask, what that <hi>original ſin</hi> is? If onely, the <hi>loſs,</hi> or <hi>want</hi> of <hi>original righteouſneſs</hi> (as <hi>Papiſts</hi> make it) is not the <hi>want</hi> of <hi>original righteouſneſs</hi> a ſin? How then is it called <hi>orginal ſin,</hi> if it be no ſin? And ſin it cannot be (in the Doctors <hi>Divinity</hi>) becauſe it is a <hi>puniſhment</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin. Then again, no <hi>infant</hi> is a ſinner, in the want of <hi>original</hi> righteouſneſs: Oh, bleſſed <hi>harmleſs</hi> babes! while they live, and ſurely all ſaved when they die young. This is the <hi>Divinity</hi> of ſome of the Doctors <hi>Schollers,</hi> which I fear they learned from him. 3.

But ſay I, the very <hi>loſs</hi> of that prudence, is a <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment</hi> of his ſin; and ſo cannot be a <hi>ſin</hi> too, by the Doctors arguing. That it is both a <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>puniſhment,</hi> the Apoſtle is clear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21, 22. <hi>[When they knew God, and glorified him not as God, &amp;c. they became vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkned, they became fools.]</hi> Is it not a <hi>ſin</hi> for a man, by his own <hi>luſts,</hi> to darken his own heart, and to put out his own eyes? yet is it alſo a <hi>puniſhment,</hi> infflicted by God upon him, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>[God gave them up to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate minde.]</hi> Much more might be added: But granting it true, of a man, <hi>infatuated</hi> by his actual ſins; yet the Doctor hath his evaſions: <hi>['Tis not appliable to the matter in hand,</hi> viz. <hi>to ſuch an high degree of prudence, as now he ſpeaks of; for of that he may come ſhort, without any degree of actual ſin, as ſhall thus infatuate, and deprive him of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.]</hi> Let the Doctor apply this to <hi>Adam</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he was <hi>alive,</hi> after his fall: He was bound to that <hi>high degree</hi> of prudence, which I ſpeak of, that he loſt by his ſin: and of that he might not, <hi>without ſin,</hi> come ſhort, though his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>actual</hi> ſins did not further <hi>infatuate</hi> him, and deprive him of that little remaining <hi>prudence</hi> which he had. <hi>Prudence</hi> in the higheſt degree, was a <hi>part</hi> or degree of the <hi>Image</hi> of God, that <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> he had, at his creation, which by his <hi>actual</hi> ſin he loſt; and is not <hi>loſs,</hi> or <hi>want</hi> of that knowledge, or <hi>Image</hi> of God, a ſin, as well as a puniſhment? If ſo in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo alſo in his poſterity. He therefore ſhifts the <hi>foot</hi> of his anſwer; <hi>[He ſpeakes of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man, by the inlightning wiſe Spirit of God return'd to that ſtate of prudence, from which his own actual ſins may have degraded him; and if

How many times a day, &amp;c. this muſt be reſolved, before he could <hi>exceed</hi> that proportion: I leave it with him, and proceed. 2. <hi>[If</hi> Adam <hi>had never finned, yet might his ſtate, he a ſtate of proficiency, and then the perfection required, was not the higheſt degree of Piety, &amp;c.]</hi> The <hi>Antecedent</hi> is very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that his <hi>state</hi> was a ſtate of <hi>proficiency;</hi> he was as <hi>perfect</hi> and complete in his kinde, as his <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> could hold; as the <hi>Angels</hi> were (it's probable) as <hi>full of holineſs,</hi> at their creation, as they are now; and ſo the <hi>Saints</hi> after the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as <hi>perfectly holy,</hi> as to eternity; no <hi>profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> in grace; that's for <hi>viatores,</hi> not for <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſores:</hi> And hence it's evident, that the <hi>higheſt degree</hi> of Piety was required of him, and he had ſinned, by any lower; contrary to the Doctors conſequence. 3. That <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity ſhould have been <hi>rewarded</hi> according to their works, (the Doctors third argument) is true; but that they ſhould have had <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>rewards,</hi> is at beſt a <hi>probleme,</hi> and upon the former ground, of a

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:170718:142"/>ſpeaks, incongruouſly twice. 1. In ſaying, the <hi>Law Judaical</hi> repreſented the ſecond Covenant, which the <hi>Goſpel</hi> onely holds forth. 2. That he joyns the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Laws and Ordinances, as a <hi>part</hi> of the firſt <hi>Covenant</hi> with the <hi>Moral</hi> Law, which alone was the <hi>Covenant</hi> of works to <hi>Adam.</hi> Neither did that Law repreſent the ſecond <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> at all; for the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law of <hi>Sacrifices, &amp;c.</hi> did onely repreſent <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and this was a <hi>Goſpel diſpenſation,</hi> and beſide the <hi>promiſes</hi> of Chriſt, obſcurely intimated, this was a <hi>great part</hi> of the <hi>Jewes</hi> Goſpel. Hence it will follow, that the <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>Holineſs</hi> which that Law of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſo conſidered, required, was not onely <hi>ſincerity</hi> and truth of Holineſs, but (as he ſaid) <hi>unfinning perfect obedience,</hi> and pronouncing a curſe, &amp;c. <hi>Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> of Holineſs, as it was alſo required in the Law, is <hi>accepted</hi> onely in the Goſpel: Then <hi>Zach.</hi> and <hi>Eliz.</hi> were not juſt with reſpect to the <hi>Judaical</hi> Law, but the <hi>Goſpel</hi> diſpenſation. And when we hear of any, ſaid to be <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> it muſt be underſtood <hi>Evangelically,</hi> not <hi>Legally</hi> and ſtrictly: for properly there is no <hi>perfection,</hi> but what <hi>exactly</hi> anſwers to the <hi>perfection</hi> of the Law.

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 205. <hi>n.</hi> 11</note> and he does ſo, preſently: <hi>[There is beſide, in every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, a latitude alſo, and in it, as it were fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all this little enough to bear proportion with them different works of pious men here, or their glory hereafter.]</hi> But, firſt, In this <hi>Arithmeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> or <hi>Geometrical</hi> proportion, the Doctor forgat where to place the <hi>four firſt degrees</hi> of <hi>Zeal, Piety, Perfection;</hi> and I can think of none but <hi>Heathens</hi> to be a fit ſubject of them; ſo that ſome, at leaſt four <hi>degrees</hi> of them muſt be found in an <hi>Heathen,</hi> five, in a <hi>Jew,</hi> ſix, at leaſt in a Chriſtian: If then an <hi>Heathen</hi> arrive, at the fourth degree, he is <hi>perfect</hi> in his latitude; a <hi>Jew</hi> at five, &amp;c. And no marvel, for the Doctor made (above) the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> to be very pious men, and more <hi>devout</hi> then their neighbours, 2. But then again, I would ask,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:170718:143"/>what if the <hi>Heathen</hi> come ſhort of the fourth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the Jew of the fifth, the Chriſtian of the ſixth, are they perfect or imperfect, in that poſture? That they are yet <hi>perfect,</hi> according to the Doctors <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,</hi> (for <hi>Divinity</hi> it is not) is proved from this, that his <hi>latitude</hi> of perfection, takes in all the eight degrees; <hi>ergo,</hi> he is <hi>perfect</hi> that hath but <hi>one degree,</hi> as well as he that hath four being an <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> or five being a Jew, or ſix being a Chriſtian: Nay, he that <hi>hath the loweſt fraction of the ſixth degree, hath the ſixth degree;</hi> then he that hath the loweſt <hi>fraction</hi> of the fifth, hath the fifth; and ſo of the fourth. And why then hath not he that hath but <hi>one degree,</hi> nay one <hi>fraction</hi> of that firſt degree, a right to challenge <hi>perfection,</hi> as will as he that hath four, five, or ſix degrees. 3. If he ſhall ſay, He that falls <hi>ſhort</hi> of the fifth degree, being a Jew, falls ſhort of <hi>perfection,</hi> and is imperfect; and he that falls ſhort of the ſixth degree, being a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> falls ſhort of perfection, and is <hi>imperfect;</hi> then I would ask by what <hi>Rule</hi> of Scripture, or right reaſon, is he <hi>imperfect,</hi> that falls ſhort of five, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Jew;</hi> or ſix, being a <hi>Christian;</hi> and yet he that arrives at five, or ſix, yea, the loweſt fraction of that degree, ſaid to be <hi>perfect;</hi> ſeeing he alſo falls ſhort of the eighth, which is ſuppoſed the <hi>higheſt degree</hi> of perfection. 4. <hi>Divinty</hi> would rather ſay; ſuppoſing <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> to require eight degrees; he is onely <hi>perfectly zealous,</hi> and <hi>perfectly pious,</hi> who arrives at the eighth degree, and all theſe that fall ſhort, more or leſs, of that degree, to be more or leſs (not <hi>perfect,</hi> for that they are not, but) <hi>imperfect,</hi> and ſo no degrees of perfection; what is <hi>leſs</hi> then it <hi>ought</hi> to be, is <hi>in vitio,</hi> ſo far faulty, and ſinful; as we ſhall hear anon. As <hi>fractions</hi> therefore in <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> are <hi>imperfect</hi> numbers; ſo thoſe <hi>degrees</hi> of Zeal and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:170718:143"/>Piety, in <hi>Divinity,</hi> are <hi>imperfect</hi> virtues: there may be degrees of <hi>virtues, Zeal, Piety, &amp;c.</hi> but no degrees of <hi>perfection.</hi> But enough and too much of this fine ſpeculation.</p>
               <p>The next about degrees of <hi>mercy,</hi> is bottom'd upon the ſame <hi>airy ſpeculation.</hi> 1.

                  <p>This depends upon the former, and ſtands or falls with it; for the <hi>perfection</hi> the Doctor means, is of <hi>vertues</hi> above command, or (in his own words) <hi>uncommanded degrees of vertue.</hi> And here the Doctor muſt hold out a new <hi>coin'd diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> of <hi>perfection</hi> of virtues, under the Law, and perfection of <hi>virtues</hi> above the <hi>Law:</hi> for ſo he does,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:170718:148"/>in effect, when he ſays, <hi>[A man may come to the perfection, which the Law requires, and yet come ſhort, or go beyond it; to an higher degree of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in uncommanded degrees of virtues.]</hi> Nay more, <hi>[The latitude of vertues under command is ſo large,]</hi> (like the <hi>diſtance,</hi> between the <hi>Tropicks</hi>) that a man may tumble up &amp; down, &amp; arrive at the leaſt degree of perfection, required by the Law; be yet more perfect if he arrive at an higher degree, not commanded by the Law; though (which is a contradiction) under the command of the Law. This may be gathered from <hi>n.</hi> 10, 11. by his eight <hi>degrees</hi> of perfection; and the <hi>fractions</hi> in every degree: Let the Reader turn back, and conſider if it be not ſo. But beſides this, there are <hi>degrees</hi> of perfection, (beyond the <hi>Tropicks</hi>) in <hi>uncommanded</hi> vertues, above the Law, I know not how many: and thoſe we now are to conſider; One or two <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> may ſuffice to ruine this opinion. [1. <hi>If there be no virtues above command, then there is no perfection above command.</hi>] The <hi>conſequence</hi> is clear, becauſe the Doctor by <hi>perfection</hi> here, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands <hi>uncommanded</hi> virtues, or above command: The <hi>Antecedent is proved by four arguments,</hi> to the former queſtion; ergo. 2. [<hi>If the Law be the</hi> abſolute <hi>and onely Rule of perfection, then there can be no perfection above command: But the firſt is true,</hi> Pſal. 19.7. Jam. 1.25.] The <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> is evident, and needs no proof. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor then muſt finde out ſome <hi>diſtinctions</hi> to evade this; either, firſt, That of <hi>Papiſts, [There is a two-fold perfection; firſt, perfect, according to the Law; or imperfect, ſutable to our frailty;]</hi> Which ſeems a <hi>contradiction in adjecto,</hi> an <hi>imperfect perfection:</hi> yet ſo they ſpeak. 2. That of his own; <hi>[Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is capable of a double notion: either it may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie unſinning obedience; or any higher degree of
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:170718:148"/>exerciſe of any particular vertue, chaſtity, mercy, &amp;c.]</hi> Of which more, when we come at it. <hi>p.</hi> 214. <hi>n.</hi> 37. Onely ſaying now, that theſe <hi>diſtinctions</hi> are almoſt the ſame, with that of our <hi>Divines,</hi> that <hi>perfection</hi> is either <hi>legal,</hi> which is properly perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; or <hi>Evangelical,</hi> improperly called ſo, by <hi>Divine indulgence</hi> and acceptance. But this will ſtand him in no ſtead here; the queſtion being, <hi>[whether there be any perfection above command,]</hi> above the Law; not whether there be any <hi>other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> in the Goſpel above the Law. And this would have fitted the Doctor better, who holds, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath <hi>perfected</hi> the Law, and brought in an <hi>higher degree</hi> of perfection, then was required by the Law: as we ſhall hear ere long: in this <hi>ſenſe,</hi> he might ſay, there is a <hi>perfection</hi> above the Law; that is, in the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> but this is not to the purpoſe; for even that perfection, is under the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and ſo not above command. 3. Adde this one argument more, that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der obligation on men to do, is not above, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome command (the reaſon and proof of this is, becauſe obligation to do any thing ſuppoſes a command.) But the moſt Heroical vertues, or works, are under obligation to be done: This is proved thus, thoſe works which are done by ſome ſpecial gift and ſtrength from God, are, <hi>co nomine,</hi> under ſome obligation to be done; but thoſe high works are done by ſome ſpecial gift and ſtrength from God (and cannot be done without it.) The Minor is evident and needs no proof: the Major is proved by that maxime univerſal of our Saviour, [<hi>To whomſoever much is given, of him much is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more,</hi> Luke 12.48.] But to thoſe heroical workers, much and more is given; therefore much and more will be required, and ſo
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:170718:149"/>they are not above command. For this we have the Doctors own conceſſion: <hi>[Whatſoever degree of perfection, either by doing or ſuffering, we can aſpire to, it is ſtill the work of Gods good grace and ſtrength in us, (for what hast thou which thou hast not received? and then what place for glorying?</hi> p. 224. <hi>n.</hi> 3.] Let him conſider how he will recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile himſelf to himſelf, who above allowed of boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>ad p.</hi> 185. <hi>n.</hi> 5. 6.</p>

                  <p>This is alſo taken for <hi>granted</hi> by the Doctor, but never proved; but our <hi>Divines,</hi> generally deny it, and oppoſe <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who affirm it.

He muſt then underſtand it of <hi>ſingle life,</hi> or an unmarried ſtate; which I gather, becauſe he ſpeaks of <hi>undertaking thoſe courſes be it of Virginity, &amp;c.</hi> and elſewhere ſays, <hi>[It is not commanded, but looked on as the greateſt degree of perfection]</hi> I wonder he did not except <hi>Martyrdome,</hi> for reaſons which he knows, but let it paſs. Take it then, for <hi>ſingle life;</hi> I would make bold to ask, how is <hi>ſingle
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:170718:150"/>life</hi> a vertue? and if it be, is not <hi>Marriage</hi> a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue too? they are but differing <hi>ſtates</hi> of life: [<hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (ſays Doctor</hi> Hall) <hi>hath taught us not to call Virginity a vertue; though couſin germane to a vertue.</hi>] But ſure that muſt be, when <hi>Virginity,</hi> that is <hi>ſingle life,</hi> is attended with <hi>chaſtity</hi> of body and ſpirit: elſe it's far enough from <hi>vertue.</hi> But by the ſame reaſon, <hi>Chaſte Marriage</hi> may as well be called, a <hi>vertue,</hi> or of <hi>kin</hi> to a vertue: both <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly</hi> enough. Does he then place the <hi>vertue,</hi> in the <hi>undertaking,</hi> or <hi>vowing</hi> of it, as <hi>Papiſts</hi> do? That ſeems his meaning: But that is <hi>no vertue,</hi> the <hi>vertue</hi> is rather in <hi>keeping</hi> of the vow, then making it. Then again, how is his <hi>Virginity,</hi> or <hi>ſingle life, perfection,</hi> or the <hi>greateſt</hi> degree of perfection? Why <hi>marriage</hi> ſhould not be a <hi>ſtate,</hi> and as great a ſtate of <hi>perfection,</hi> as <hi>ſingle</hi> life, I ſee no reaſon; ſeeing God himſelf brought the <hi>firſt couple,</hi> from <hi>Virginity</hi> to a <hi>Married ſtate;</hi> and hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it <hi>honourable,</hi> which he ſaid not of a <hi>ſingle life.</hi> Let him take it in what ſenſe he pleaſe; I ſhall prove it is neither <hi>vertue,</hi> nor <hi>higher degree</hi> of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is no <hi>vertue,</hi> that's proved by ſome of the arguments to the firſt queſtion; firſt, <hi>[Every vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is under ſome command; but Virginity or ſingle life is under no command.]</hi> The <hi>Minor,</hi> is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors <hi>main</hi> aſſertion: The <hi>Major</hi> is proved in the firſt: A <hi>vertue</hi> muſt be under <hi>ſome Rule,</hi> that guides it's <hi>conformity, &amp;c.</hi> As then, every <hi>vice</hi> is under ſome <hi>prohibition,</hi> ſo, every <hi>vertue</hi> muſt be under ſome precept. Secondly, if <hi>Virginity</hi> be a vertue, it hath its <hi>oppoſite vices,</hi> (as was ſaid in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral above.) But <hi>virginity,</hi> or <hi>ſingle</hi> life hath no oppoſite vices: or what ſhall they be: what the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs?</hi> what the <hi>defect?</hi> I hope he will not ſay, <hi>Marriage</hi> is either of the <hi>extremes.</hi> Thirdly,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:170718:150"/>things in themſelves <hi>indifferent,</hi> are neither <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> nor <hi>vices;</hi> nor yet the <hi>uſing</hi> or not <hi>uſing</hi> of them, vertuous, or ſinful: But <hi>ſingle life</hi> (<hi>as</hi> alſo <hi>marriage</hi>) are in themſelves, things <hi>indifferent,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commanded nor prohibited, but left free, to the <hi>qualifications</hi> of the perſons; <hi>ergo,</hi> they are no <hi>vertues,</hi> nor <hi>vices.</hi> Fourthly, No <hi>vertue</hi> can ever be a <hi>vice</hi> or ſinfull: but it may be <hi>ſinful</hi> for ſome to <hi>undertake</hi> ſingle life; that is, ſuch as have not the <hi>gift</hi> of continency. Laſtly, that which may fall <hi>under</hi> a command, may not be called as <hi>uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vertue:</hi> But <hi>ſingle</hi> life may fall to ſome, to be under a <hi>command;</hi> of which in the next.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is no high, or <hi>higher perfection,</hi> then <hi>Marriage.</hi> This is proved. 1. <hi>[Becauſe it is no vertue, as hath been proved,]</hi> and of the <hi>perfection</hi> of vertues, we are ſpeaking. 2. <hi>Marriage</hi> is an <hi>honourable Ordinance</hi> of God, <hi>Virginity</hi> is but an <hi>impoſition</hi> of a man: Now it ſeemes <hi>abſur'd,</hi> that a <hi>voluntary inſtitution</hi> of man, ſhould be a <hi>more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate,</hi> then an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God? 3. The <hi>undertaking</hi> of a thing <hi>indifferent,</hi> is not <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable</hi> in it ſelf, as the <hi>neglect</hi> of it, is no <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour,</hi> and ſo no <hi>high perfection</hi> to undertake it. But <hi>Virginity,</hi> or <hi>ſingle life,</hi> is a thing <hi>indifferent,</hi> onely <hi>commendable</hi> in the <hi>end</hi> of undertaking it, the <hi>greater glory,</hi> or <hi>ſervice</hi> of God, which may be and ought to be our <hi>ends</hi> in all <hi>uſe</hi> of <hi>indifferent</hi> things; <hi>[Whether eat, or drink, &amp;c.]</hi> 4. The undertaking a thing, that may be <hi>under</hi> command, is no <hi>high perfection,</hi> but a duty: But ſingle life may <hi>fall</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a command. For thus I argue; <hi>[A man ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath the gift of continency from God, (for it is a ſpecial gift) and then God calls him to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life, to be freer to his ſervice; and ſo it will prove a duty: or he hath not the gift, and then it
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170718:151"/>is his duty to marry,]</hi> (as was ſaid long ago.) If he ſhall ſay, though a man hath the <hi>gift of continency,</hi> yet the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. leaves it <hi>free</hi> for him to <hi>marry;</hi> and then if he <hi>voluntarily</hi> abſtain, that's the <hi>vertue,</hi> and <hi>high degree</hi> of perfection, which he ſpeaks of: I anſwer, that is denied by ſome; <hi>[That he that knows he hath the gift, may marry, but it his duty not to marry (as above,)</hi> Qui poteſt capere, capiat, <hi>is ſay they, a</hi> charge <hi>to the</hi> able.] And the Doctor himſelf ſays in this very place, <hi>n.</hi> 27. <hi>[I hope it is not every mans duty, but at the utmoſt his, who can receive it.]</hi> Where he <hi>inclines</hi> to think it is a <hi>duty</hi> to him that can <hi>receive</hi> it: and then it's <hi>no perfection,</hi> much leſs a <hi>great</hi> one. 5. To place vertue, or <hi>perfection,</hi> in any thing, or <hi>ſtate</hi> of life, which God hath not placed in it, is <hi>ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> and ſinful: ſo the Doctor <hi>Superſt. Sect.</hi> 45. But God hath not (though the Doctor hath) pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vertue, a high and more <hi>perfection,</hi> in ſingle life, then in Marriage; <hi>ergo,</hi> The Doctor and <hi>Papiſts</hi> with him, are ſinfully <hi>ſuperſtitious.</hi> And now I come to the laſt queſtion.</p>

                  <p>That a <hi>Counſel</hi> differs from a <hi>Precept</hi> in this, that the one obſerved brings a <hi>reward,</hi> neglected, a <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment;</hi> (that's the latter) and the other, (the <hi>Counſel</hi>) brings no puniſhment if neglected, and a greater reward if obſerved, is the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts:</hi> the Doctor ſpeaks the ſame <hi>language</hi> for the latter part, for his <hi>uncommanded</hi> vertues; that they are more <hi>commendable,</hi> more acceptable, more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardable, then <hi>works</hi> done, that are <hi>under</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.

I ſhall produce them in order, and conſider what he ſays to them. [1. <hi>The Law it ſelf requires perfect obedience of Chriſtians.</hi>] To this he ſayes, two things, [1. <hi>The Law, not the Moſaical, but that of the firſt covenant, required perfect unſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning obedience; but this is not now in force with faithful penitent Chriſtians, who are not now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, but under grace: the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which requires not innocence, but repentance ſincere, not perfect obedience.</hi>] But here are many <hi>miſadventures.</hi> 1. The Catechiſt told us. <hi>[The Judaical law, did repreſent to us the firſt cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, by requiring perfect obedience, and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a curſe upon him, that continued not in all things, &amp;c.] Pract.

                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:170718:158"/>2. This <hi>Law Moſaical,</hi> the <hi>moral</hi> Law, is ſtill in force, to <hi>unbelieving</hi> and <hi>impenitent</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, they are ſtill <hi>under the Law,</hi> and under the curſe, though it ſhould not be in force with <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>penitent</hi> ones. 3. But even <hi>faithful Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and penitent, are <hi>under</hi> the Law, as it is a <hi>Rule</hi> of righteouſneſs, though not as the <hi>firſt covenant</hi> or elſe the Doctor muſt turn <hi>Antinomian.</hi> 4. Nor is it <hi>Orthodox</hi> to ſay, the <hi>covenant of grace</hi> (or the Law in the hand of a <hi>Mediator</hi>) required not <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,</hi> but <hi>repentance,</hi> I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

The very Goſpel requires <hi>perfect obedience,</hi> (the Doctor ſays <hi>perfecter</hi>) as well as the Law, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. but then the rigor of <hi>forfeiture</hi> in failing, is by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>perfect righteouſneſs</hi> abated; there's <hi>mercy</hi> concerning this, which the <hi>Law</hi> knew not of.

The arguments whereupon the <hi>Fathers</hi> built their Interpretation, are of no ſtrength; 1. <hi>[Becauſe Chriſt under the Goſpel, gives either higher or plainer promiſes, then he did before; eternal life, as thoſe of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> Canaan.] As for <hi>plainer,</hi> it may be granted, but that makes no difference in the Law, the <hi>Jewes</hi> being under <hi>clouds</hi> and ſhadows, <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the

This makes no <hi>difference,</hi> but rather ſeemes to imply, that the <hi>precepts</hi> were the very ſame; there was onely <hi>leſs grace</hi> diſpenſed to perform them. 2. If he do give <hi>more</hi> grace, yet if he lay <hi>higher</hi> precepts, of <hi>greater perfection,</hi> then the Law required; a leſs <hi>ſtrength</hi> to a <hi>leſſer burthen,</hi> might do as well, as a <hi>greater,</hi> to a greater; yea, no doubt, ſome of the <hi>Saints</hi> under the old <hi>diſpenſation,</hi> did perform them as <hi>exactly,</hi> as any under the new: then, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>grace</hi> was the ſame to both, or the Law <hi>equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfect</hi> to either.

                  <hi>[Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther every man be bound to do that which is beſt.]</hi> The <hi>falſeneſs</hi> of the affirmative, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor undertakes to diſcover. 1. <hi>[By the words of the Apoſtle, he that Marries doth well, but he that Marrieth not, doth better.]</hi> I ſaid, <hi>well</hi> and <hi>better</hi> there refer to <hi>worldly</hi> good; in thoſe <hi>perſecuting</hi> times: So the Apoſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>[For the preſent diſtreſs.]</hi> This he ſays, [<hi>will be ſoon ſhaken aſſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> 1. By conſidering that, <hi>well</hi> belongs to moral goodneſs, ver. 28. If thou Marry thou ſinneſt not; doing well, is not ſinning, and that's a moral good.] But I pray Sir, is not, <hi>doing well,</hi> more then <hi>not ſinning,</hi> if taken of <hi>moral</hi> good? and if taken of <hi>worldly</hi> good, not <hi>ſinning,</hi> is not doing well. The truth is, the Doctor here <hi>equivocates</hi> with us; theſe texts have no <hi>reſpect</hi> to one another in regard of good and evil moral: <hi>[It's good, for the preſent diſtreſs, I ſay, it's good for a man ſo to be,]</hi> to be a <hi>Virgine</hi> or <hi>unmarryed:</hi> This muſt neceſſarily be underſtood of a <hi>worldly</hi> good, in reſpect of the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſtreſs,</hi> to prevent trouble, &amp;c. But if <hi>Good</hi> be meant of <hi>moral</hi> good here, then it muſt needs follow, that it's <hi>morally evil</hi> to Marry; it's evil for a man ſo to be, that is, to Marry; <hi>moral</hi> good, and moral evil are oppoſed; not <hi>moral</hi> good, and <hi>world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> evil. The 28. ver. is an anſwer to a ſecret <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> (which the Doctor makes by his <hi>ſenſe;</hi>) If it be good not to Marry, <hi>morally</hi> good, then it's
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:170718:165"/>
                  <hi>morally evil</hi> to Marry. No ſays the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> if thou Marryeſt, thou ſinneſt not: but take this with it, ſuch ſhall have <hi>trouble</hi> in the fleſh; that is, <hi>worldly</hi> evil, at this time attends upon <hi>Marriage;</hi> therefore it's <hi>worldly</hi> good, not to Marry, though it be <hi>no ſin</hi> to Marry. Hence the 38. ver. alledged by the Doctor, muſt be underſtood of the <hi>ſame kinde</hi> of good; both the well, and the better: He that <hi>Marries</hi> does well, there's no <hi>ſin,</hi> but onely <hi>trouble</hi> in it; but he that Marries not, does <hi>better,</hi> (ſuppoſing the gift of continency, elſe he does <hi>worſe</hi> not to Marry) becauſe of the <hi>preſent diſtreſs;</hi> there's no <hi>ſinning</hi> in either; but in <hi>worldly</hi> reſpects, he does better, that <hi>Marries</hi> not. But the Doctor hath a ſecond anſwer:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>n.</hi> 53. <hi>p.</hi> 219</note> 
                  <hi>[Marrying is quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to worldly good, ſuch ſhall have trouble in the fleſh.]</hi> This ſure is a great miſtake, how is <hi>Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</hi> contrary to <hi>worldly</hi> good? not in a worldly <hi>reſpect,</hi> as Marriage is a <hi>civil</hi> thing; if Marriage be good, as it is, and <hi>neceſſary</hi> for ſome; worldly <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> are not contrary to Marriage, but many times coincident. Not in a <hi>moral</hi> reſpect, is Marriage quite contrary to worldly good: for <hi>moral</hi> good &amp; world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good or evil are not contrary: But if <hi>worldly</hi> good, as Marriage is, be oppoſed to <hi>worldly</hi> evil; they are not yet contrary, but <hi>divers</hi> things in the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: Marriage good, and troubles ill. A third anſwer is from ver. 32. <hi>[The advantages of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; the unmarryed careth for the things of the Lord, how he may pleaſe the Lord, &amp;c. which are (not barely worldly) ſpiritual advantages, and a greater moral or ſpiritual good, then the caring for the things of the world to pleaſe a yoke-fellow:]</hi> But, 1. Every thing that may be an <hi>advantage</hi> to a <hi>moral</hi> and ſpiritual good, is not preſently to be accounted it ſelf, a <hi>moral</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual</hi> good: <hi>Riches</hi> are a great advantage, to do more good, but yet
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:170718:165"/>are not <hi>moral</hi> goods. A <hi>Church</hi> is an <hi>advantage</hi> to the publick <hi>ſervice</hi> of God, and in ſome <hi>ſenſe,</hi> better then a <hi>field</hi> or <hi>wood,</hi> yet not a <hi>moral</hi> good; and many ſuch like. And it may be ſaid, he that hath riches, is <hi>better</hi> then he that wants them, not <hi>morally,</hi> but in reſpect of a <hi>worldly</hi> advantage to do more good; and they that may <hi>ſerve</hi> God in an <hi>houſe</hi> or field do well, but they that have a <hi>Church</hi> do better; that is, have better <hi>accommodations</hi> to ſerve God; which yet are neither <hi>moral</hi> nor <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> goods: ſay the like of <hi>Marriage,</hi> and <hi>ſingle life.</hi> But this (he ſays) <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of him that hath the gift, <hi>[That if he Marry he does well, if not, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;]</hi> that is, ſay I, neither wayes he <hi>ſins;</hi> but in regard of <hi>freedom</hi> from the troubles of the times, and more <hi>liberty</hi> to ſerve God, he that Marries not, doth <hi>better;</hi> which if he will underſtand of <hi>morally better,</hi> he having the <hi>gift</hi> and yet Marrying,

Mark once more the Doctors words, <hi>[Is not the holineſs of body and ſpirit, and the caring for the things of the Lord, a greater moral, or rather ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good, then the bare caring for the things of the world, to pleaſe a yoke-fellow?].</hi> 1. This ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a man that is <hi>Marryed</hi> cannot <hi>be holy in body and ſpirit, and care</hi> for the things of the Lord, as the <hi>unmarryed</hi> may: which is a <hi>diſhonour</hi> caſt upon Gods <hi>ordinance,</hi> of <hi>honourable</hi> Marriage. 2. That a Married man does <hi>barely care</hi> for the world, to <hi>pleaſe</hi> his wife. 3. That it is not as <hi>morally</hi> good for a <hi>married</hi> man, to <hi>care</hi> for his <hi>family,</hi> and to <hi>pleaſe</hi> his wife, as for the <hi>unmarried,</hi> to care to <hi>pleaſe</hi> God: when both <hi>pleaſe</hi> God, and there need no <hi>compariſon.</hi> 4. If <hi>Virginity,</hi> or <hi>ſingle life,</hi> were morally <hi>better,</hi> then <hi>Marriage,</hi> the Apoſtle neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the chiefeſt argument to <hi>perſwade</hi> it, the <hi>greater
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:170718:166"/>reward</hi> in heaven, as a <hi>greater good work;</hi> for ſo the Doctor determines; this <hi>Free-will offering,</hi> is more <hi>commendable, acceptable, rewardable.</hi> But not one word of this, in all the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> What ever ſome <hi>Ancients,</hi> and many <hi>Papiſts</hi> preſume to <hi>dictate,</hi> of an <hi>higher glory</hi> for <hi>Virginity,</hi> then for <hi>Marriage;</hi> and uſe this, if not as the <hi>onely,</hi> yet as the <hi>chiefeſt</hi> perſwaſive.

What then is affirmed of Chriſt, is not <hi>common</hi> to Angels and men, with him. 1. If it were granted, that Chriſt was more <hi>ardent</hi> in one act of Prayer then in another, this is not applyable to the ſame <hi>Angel</hi> who is not more <hi>ardent</hi> in one act, of <hi>love</hi> or <hi>zeal,</hi> then another, ſure the Doctor cannot prove it. 2. Chriſt was far more <hi>perfect</hi> in love then Angels, being God man, not having the ſpirit by meaſure; therefore he might ſupererogate (as I ſaid) in his acts of love and expreſſions of it, though Angels cannot. 4. Nor then is it common to Chriſt with men, to love God more in one act then another, being <hi>perfect</hi> in love, with a <hi>ſinleſs</hi> perfection; the moſt that men can do, being but to love God <hi>ſincerely,</hi> which is capable of degrees, but <hi>faulty</hi> in the lower. 5. Even the <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity</hi> that was in Chriſts love, was <hi>ſinleſs,</hi> and <hi>perfect;</hi> but ſo it is not in men, whoſe love being leſs or more <hi>ſincere,</hi> is leſs or more imperfect. 6. His diſtinction here, of <hi>ſinleſs</hi> perfection, (which he renounces) and <hi>ſincerity</hi> of this or that virtue, which (he ſays) conſiſts in a <hi>latitude</hi> and
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:170718:170"/>hath degrees, and a mixture of ſin in the man, &amp;c. Is firſt very <hi>improper;</hi> for he ſhould have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed plainly, <hi>[perfection is either ſinleſs or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,]</hi> (As Papiſts bluſh not to do) but this had daſht his plot of perfection in lower degrees (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many are with him <hi>ſinleſs</hi>) as (we ſaid elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. 2.
<note place="margin">Even here the loweſt ſinleſs.</note> If he ſpeak not of ſinleſs (but ſinful) perfection, why did he bring in the example of Chriſt, or Angels, whoſe perfection is <hi>ſinleſs,</hi> as well as <hi>ſincere? ſincerity</hi> in Chriſt was not capable of degrees (any more then his <hi>perfect love.</hi>) And yet the Doctor concludes here, [<hi>Why</hi> ſincerity <hi>may not in a pious Chriſtian be capable of degrees, as well as in Chriſt himſelf, and (mark it) the loweſt of them be ſinleſs there is no reaſon ſhewed,]</hi> when he renounced before <hi>ſinleſs perfection.</hi>

And yet there will appear but little difference between his <hi>Principles</hi> and theirs: Firſt, he put a difference <hi>[between doing
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:170718:171"/>more then is commanded, and doing ſomething which is not commanded.]</hi> I ſaid, he that does ſomething <hi>not commanded,</hi> does alſo <hi>more</hi> then is commanded, and ſo they are, in that ſenſe, both one: and the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do not ſuppoſe, that he that hath done <hi>more</hi> then is commanded, hath done <hi>all</hi> that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, to ſet their <hi>Supererogation</hi> upon. Then it will follow, that he and they agree in this <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; [That Superogation is founded upon doing ſomething not commanded:]</hi> which he makes evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by a ſecond diſtinction: <hi>[To Supererogate ſuppoſes, either that the perſon hath paid God all that is due to him, that is, hath never ſinned,]</hi> (which is the ſame (ſaid I) with the firſt part of the former diſtinction, that he hath done <hi>all</hi> that is commanded, which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do not own.) <hi>[Or that having ſinned and ſo become a debter, he hath paid that debt by ſatisfaction, by doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, which may ſatisfie God for his ſin.]</hi> That is, (ſaid I) by doing <hi>ſomething not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded:</hi> In this latter, he placed the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> opinion. Now this <hi>principle</hi> is his as well as theirs, <hi>[A man may do ſomething not commanded:]</hi> This he hath often aſſerted, and expreſly here below, <hi>n.</hi> 12. <hi>[I affirm it poſſible for a Chriſtian to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is not commanded him.]</hi> The ſenſe whereof we ſhall conſider,

But hear what he ſays here. <hi>[I yield that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt is not ſo groſs, as to affirm him that Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogates, not to have ſinned, and therefore never defined that to be the Romaniſts doctrine.]</hi> But ſure it is, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do ſay and <hi>affirm</hi> ſome <hi>Saints</hi> not to have ſinned; the <hi>Virgine Mary</hi> for one, to be free not onely from <hi>actual</hi> ſins, but <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> alſo; and he knows who was the <hi>man,</hi> of whom ſome of them affirm,

And yet by the way, I would ask a <hi>Romanist,</hi> whether if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, as the <hi>Angels</hi> do not, he or they could <hi>ſupererogate</hi> for themſelves or others? If they ſay, <hi>they could not,</hi> becauſe they, in doing <hi>all</hi> that is commanded, did but their <hi>duty;</hi> then, would I infer, <hi>much leſs</hi> can a <hi>ſinner</hi> Supererogate, by doing <hi>ſomething</hi> not commanded.

In general thus, by conſidering how far an <hi>hypocrite</hi> may travel in this <hi>way</hi> to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. 1.

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:170718:175"/>and the Doctor will not ſay, his <hi>pious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> can or doth <hi>abſtain</hi> from all ſins. 2.

When he hath <hi>failed</hi> (if at leaſt he may fail) he may (in the Doctors language) ſecure his <hi>retrait</hi> by an early <hi>humiliation</hi> and confeſſion,
<note place="margin">Pray ye to the Lord for me.</note> as <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> did. 4. He may <hi>beg pardon</hi> of God, and that in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as its like <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did, who deſired others alſo to pray for him. 5. He may make an outward <hi>Reformation</hi> of his failings, in many things, as <hi>Herod</hi> did, and the Doctor will not ſay, but his <hi>Pious Chriſtian,</hi> may fail ſtill by <hi>infirmity,</hi> in ſome things repented of. 6. After all this, he may uſe <hi>Auſterities, Faſting, Watchings,</hi> and other <hi>Penances,</hi> for the <hi>mortifying</hi> of his luſts, at leaſt in pretence, as <hi>Papiſts</hi> do, and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did. 7. And then he may proceed to <hi>ſuperſtruct</hi> doing of <hi>good works</hi> of the more eminent <hi>uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded degrees</hi> of virtue: (for I obſerve none ſuch named by the Doctor, but an <hi>hypocrite</hi> may do them) as give <hi>alms</hi> liberally, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did, above what the Law required; <hi>[If I give all my goods to the poor, and have not charity,]</hi> (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the eaſe poſſible) I <hi>am nothing:</hi> He may be frequent in Praying five or ſix times a day, in <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings, twice</hi> or <hi>thrice</hi> a week, and in other ſuch <hi>Auſterities</hi> as afore: He may make himſelf an <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch,</hi> undertake to profeſs a <hi>ſingle life,</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to <hi>pleaſe</hi> God better: Nay, he may offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>voluntary Martyrdome,</hi> (which two laſt, are the Doctors <hi>higheſt perfections</hi> of all.) <hi>[If I give my body to be burned (for Religion, for Chriſt) and have not Charity.]</hi> Suppoſes that caſe alſo

<note place="margin">Elſe they are but as Cyphers in Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but make a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure more by conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> and higheſt <hi>perfection,</hi> may of themſelves expect <hi>ſome reward,</hi> or <hi>accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> from God, by whomſoever they are done, though he have not done <hi>all</hi> that is commanded.

The Doctor puts us a caſe, <hi>[ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe two men equal in obediences, one exceeding the other in acts of uncommanded perfection, this ſhall have the richer reward.]</hi> Juſt the Popiſh <hi>dream</hi> of <hi>Aurea</hi> and <hi>Aureola:</hi> But let me put him a caſe; Suppoſe two men <hi>unequal</hi> in obediences (no doubt, but ſuch there are) and he that hath the <hi>leaſt</hi> of obedience, (whether by <hi>frailty</hi> or otherwiſe) hath exceeded the other in acts of <hi>uncommanded</hi> vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues:

                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:170718:178"/>which is, <hi>[That a man may do uncommanded works, or, that there are uncommanded virtues, of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perfection, above commanded virtues:]</hi> So they, ſo he aſſerts. 2.

Hence his argument for <hi>Infant Baptiſme</hi> (of that I think he means it alſo) from the <hi>cuſtome</hi> of the <hi>Jewes</hi> to <hi>Baptize,</hi> is not <hi>conſtringent</hi> to a gain-ſayer, I believe he findes it ſo in his conflict with Maſter <hi>Tombs:</hi> for how eaſie were it to anſwer, (as I remember he does) it was the <hi>cuſtome</hi> of the <hi>Jewes</hi> to <hi>Circumciſe</hi> after Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianty began, to keep the old <hi>Sabbath,</hi> &amp; whats that to <hi>Christians?</hi> And if my judgement were of any worth with the Doctor, I ſhould make bold to tell him my <hi>conjecture</hi> in this caſe.

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:170718:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>firſt plantation of the Faith: But then I would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, 1. That the <hi>Feſtivals</hi> of <hi>Paſch</hi> and <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt,</hi> called after, <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> were no <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> conſtitutions, but rather <hi>charitable condeſcenſions</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and after <hi>Planters,</hi> to win the <hi>Jews</hi> to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion. But not as taught them by <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> nor to continue any more, then the <hi>old Sabbath</hi> or <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> &amp;c. Which by degrees vaniſhed. Elſe I would ask, why was not the old <hi>Sabbath</hi> perpetuated in the <hi>Church</hi> Chriſtian, aſwel as <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide;</hi> there being more to be ſaid for it, in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical practice</hi> and other wayes, then is or can be produced for thoſe <hi>Foſtivals,</hi> as I have elſewhere ſaid. 2. I would alſo infer, that <hi>Feſtivals</hi> were continued or <hi>exchanged,</hi> for ſome <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> ones, (as <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> for the <hi>Saturnalia</hi>) to win them the better to the <hi>faith;</hi> not to be continued longer, then the <hi>Faith</hi> was well fettled: But ſuch is the miſchief of humane <hi>policies</hi> in Religion, that ill <hi>uſages</hi> once brought in, can ſeldom or hardly be gotten out again. 3. The Doctors argument is as little <hi>conſtringent</hi> as mine, that thoſe <hi>[uſages muſt needs be brought in, at the firſt converſion of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,]</hi> which might come in by degrees.</p>

[<hi>The mention of the Lords-day;</hi> Rev. 1. <hi>is ſome farther ground; if it be the annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, then there is a clear evidence for the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, in the Apoſtles days.</hi>] The Doctor is <hi>happy,</hi> if all his <hi>ſuppoſitions</hi> might be granted him; he knows, the place is generally underſtood of the <hi>Weekly-day,</hi> and what is then become of his <hi>clear</hi> evidence? But hear again, <hi>[If it ſhould be the weekly day; yet in any reaſon, the annual day of the reſurrection, was the foundation of this weekly day.]</hi> It is obſervable, that in all this diſcourſe of <hi>Feſtivals,</hi> the Doctors great <hi>deſigne</hi> is, to <hi>vilifie,</hi> if not to <hi>nullifie</hi> the authority of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> ſo to <hi>exalt</hi> above, or <hi>equal</hi> with it his <hi>Feſtivals;</hi> which (if there were no other <hi>crime</hi>) is ſufficient to ſtir the <hi>indignation,</hi> of any truly <hi>Religious</hi> man: Here he does it, and again preſently, <hi>n.</hi> 17. and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards often, as I ſhall note as I paſs on.

If the <hi>Lords weekly day,</hi> was not firſt inſtituted, how came the <hi>conteſt</hi> between the <hi>Churches,</hi> whether Eaſter day ſhould be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> or on the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> day, which might and did fall, on any other day of the week.

Saint <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> its ſaid, kept it on the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> day; how then could that be the foundation of the <hi>weekly</hi> day. And let the Doctor remember, that his <hi>Mother</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as ſhe includes <hi>Easter</hi> day, among the <hi>Sundayes,</hi> making it no otherwiſe an <hi>Holy-day;</hi> ſo ſhe founds the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> not upon the <hi>annual</hi> day, but upon the fourth <hi>Commandment.</hi> When ſhe commands this prayer to be ſaid after it, <hi>[Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this Law.]</hi> But the Doctor will either prove, or il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate what he ſaid; <hi>[As it is evident that the weekly Friday fasts in the Church, had their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, in the annual great faſt on the day of Chriſts death, in the Paſchal week.]</hi> As if the <hi>faſt</hi> on Good-friday, were of equal <hi>antiquity</hi> or <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> with the <hi>Lords-day;</hi> or humane <hi>conſtitutions,</hi> were to be a foundation for a <hi>Divine</hi> inſtitution. <hi>[That the Apoſtles did expreſly repeal thoſe Feasts,]</hi>

               <hi>[They do it in obedience to the Laws of the Church.]</hi> And ſo in other <hi>uſages</hi> of theirs: Hear his ſecond anſwer to this; <hi>[This is interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as a far greater kindneſs to them, then I have ever been guilty of, the Church may command in lawful things, therefore it may do ſo in unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things.]</hi> But firſt, what are the things <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> commands? <hi>ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of Images, the <hi>Maſs,</hi> &amp;c. He muſt know, that this will not <hi>reach</hi> to my anſwer, which is
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:170718:196"/>of <hi>obſerving</hi> by others, not <hi>commanding</hi> by the <hi>Church;</hi> and he cannot condemn the <hi>obſervers</hi> of things unlawful, commanded by the Church, till he have firſt <hi>proved,</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> had no <hi>power</hi> to command ſuch things: So by proportion, he cannot juſtifie <hi>obſervers</hi> of <hi>Feſtivals</hi> by this, that they do it in <hi>obedience</hi> to the Laws of the <hi>Church,</hi> till he have not ſuppoſed, but proved, the <hi>Church</hi> had <hi>power</hi> to inſtitute them; wherein the <hi>force</hi> of my anſwer lay, though the Doctor would not ſee it. 2. But ſpeak to the point of <hi>Holy-days;</hi> which the Doctor thinks as <hi>lawful</hi> as they do: If a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt</hi> ſhould anſwer my propoſition and queſtion; Why do you obſerve your <hi>Feſtivals?</hi> he would anſwere juſt as the Doctor does; he does it in <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> and therefore it is no <hi>Will-worſhip.</hi> But ſay I, you muſt firſt prove the <hi>Church</hi> hath <hi>power</hi> to inſtitute them: No, ſayes he, with the Doctor, I <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> that, and therefore do not <hi>prove</hi> it. What can the Doctor ſay more? He may not now come and ſay, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> commands things unlawful: (for he and they ſuppoſe <hi>Feſtivals</hi> to be lawful,) and if he ſay ſo, he <hi>condemns</hi> himſelf with them. If he ſhall ſay, they command them as <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and make them <hi>Holy-dayes,</hi> and that makes them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful: he muſt have <hi>recourſe</hi> to my anſwer. It will not excuſe the <hi>obſervers</hi> to ſay, they do it in <hi>obedience</hi> to the lawes of the <hi>Church,</hi> unleſs he prove they had <hi>power</hi> to command thoſe things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, which he cannot do: And if this anſwer be good, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> commands things <hi>unlawful</hi> when ſhe makes her <hi>Feſtival</hi> as <hi>parts</hi> of Religion and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> &amp;c. I dare put it upon this iſſue, that the Doctor is as <hi>guilty</hi> as they in theſe <hi>crimes,</hi> and does them a far <hi>greater kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
               <pb n="390" facs="tcp:170718:197"/>then I have ever been <hi>guilty</hi> of. By my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this firſt <hi>compariſon,</hi> he may ſee the <hi>unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the other three, which he would fain put as <hi>abſurdities</hi> upon me, and make me <hi>ridiculous</hi> to his <hi>Readers.</hi> I could eaſily <hi>retort</hi> them, but I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear <hi>recrimination.</hi> I ſhall onely ſay, the Doctor <hi>varies</hi> the queſtion, and then makes his <hi>Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>Compariſons; for the ſtate of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was,</hi> whether the <hi>Church</hi> may ordain, and <hi>private</hi> perſons obſerve <hi>Festivals,</hi> as <hi>Holy-dayes, parts</hi> of Worſhip, &amp;c. and then I dare make <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons</hi> and <hi>inferences</hi> with him. 1. It is as lawful for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any Church, to <hi>command</hi> other unlawful things, as to command <hi>Feſtivals</hi> or <hi>obſerve</hi> them, as <hi>Holy-dayes,</hi> as <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip, &amp;c. for both are equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. 2. There is <hi>equal unreaſonableneſs,</hi> in <hi>beſainting</hi> thoſe that are gotten into the <hi>Calendar</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>conſecrating,</hi> that is, <hi>making ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> a day, and a <hi>part</hi> of Worſhip, as in <hi>conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> a <hi>day,</hi> to the <hi>commemorating</hi> of the <hi>birth</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> upon the ſame terms: eſpecially ſome of them, which were obſerved near the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times, as that of <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Polycarp,</hi> is ſaid to be, which cannot be proved of his <hi>Feſtival:</hi> But <hi>compariſons</hi> are <hi>odious,</hi> and I forbear the reſt: he may eaſily make it out. The onely <hi>queſtion</hi> is, Whether the Doctor (as he does plead for ſome <hi>Feſtivals,</hi> which they of <hi>Rome</hi> obſerve as well as he, ſo) do not <hi>make</hi> them (as they do) <hi>Holy-days,</hi> and <hi>parts</hi> of Worſhip, &amp;c. and ſo be <hi>equally guilty</hi> of the <hi>crimes</hi> charged upon them, as they are, which ſhall by and by be manifeſted: But ſomething elſe is firſt conſiderable.</p>
            <p>The Doctor juſtified the <hi>obſervers,</hi> by their <hi>obedience</hi> to the fifth Commandment: I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:170718:197"/>that he might better have <hi>juſtified</hi> their <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> by the fourth Commandment, having found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>dayes of publick Worſhip</hi> on that Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>[It is, (ſaid he) a deſignation of Time for the ſpecial performing of publick Worſhip, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.]</hi> Now I ſuppoſed, that he by <hi>deſignation</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> had meant, the <hi>ſpecial Time</hi> there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, a <hi>weekly Sabbath;</hi> or one day in ſeven neceſſarily to be obſerved, and then he might have juſtified their <hi>obſervation,</hi> by that Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and needed not have <hi>reduced</hi> it to the fifth Commandment. But it ſeemes I was miſtaken, for he intended no ſuch thing. Hear what he ſays, <hi>[The difference is very conceiveable betwixt time or times generally conſidered, for Gods ſervice,</hi>

               <hi>and this or that particular time:]</hi> The meaning is, that <hi>ſometime</hi> is neceſſary by that Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the particular <hi>deſignation,</hi> is at the <hi>Churches</hi> diſpoſing: the former belongs to the fourth Commandment, the latter to the fifth. See but how liberal the Doctor is, to God. 1. <hi>[That God ſhould have ſome time aſſigned, for his ſervice, is of the very law of nature, and ſo much of morality, there is fundamental to the poſitive precept of the weekly Sabbath in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.]</hi> Some <hi>time,</hi> why <hi>ſome time</hi> is of the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> for the Doctor <hi>to eat his break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast;</hi> in as much, as he can do nothing, without <hi>ſome time,</hi> and this is all the <hi>morality</hi> the great <hi>School-man,</hi> and the Doctor his <hi>Symmists,</hi> allow to the fourth Commandment: which would have been <hi>moral,</hi> or rather <hi>natural,</hi> had there never been any fourth <hi>Commandment</hi> placed in the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue:</hi> But ſeeing <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Lord</hi> of us and all our time, it had been <hi>fitter</hi> to have ſaid, <hi>All our time</hi> was due to God for his ſervice, except <hi>ſome time</hi> be
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:170718:198"/>
               <hi>allowed</hi> by him, as <hi>neceſſary,</hi> for our <hi>worldly</hi> buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Beſides, this <hi>ſome time</hi> to be aſſigned for Gods <hi>ſervice,</hi> is not ſaid to be <hi>deſigned by God,</hi> in particular; but onely, that <hi>ſome time</hi> muſt be <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned;</hi> that is, by the <hi>Church,</hi> which is <hi>poorly beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi> as afore. And this is the <hi>Helena</hi> for which they ſo much contend: and no <hi>marvel;</hi> for if they can but get this <hi>granted,</hi> that the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>neceſſary ſufficient Time</hi> for Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice (a thing of moſt <hi>high concernment</hi>) is in the <hi>Church,</hi> we muſt grant, that ſhe hath <hi>power</hi> enough to <hi>inſtitute</hi> what <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> ſhe ſhall think uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, in the ſervice of God. But he is yet more <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral.</hi> [2. <hi>The fourth Commandment being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Jews, for one day in ſeven, as a fit and moderate proportion of time, it might equitably be inferred, that a Chriſtian ſhould at leaſt ſet apart one day in ſeven for our great Chriſtian purpoſes, &amp;c.</hi>] But his <hi>Colleagues</hi> ſay, that <hi>proportion</hi> of time, in the fourth Commandment was <hi>Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> and ſo void; and one day in eight or ten might be <hi>ſufficient,</hi> if the <hi>Church</hi> ſo pleaſed. And what is this <hi>equitableneſs</hi> the Doctor ſpeaks of; not <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>neceſſary,</hi> it <hi>may not be leſs,</hi> yea, <hi>muſt</hi> be ſo much at leaſt; but <hi>fit,</hi> and <hi>convenient,</hi> to be <hi>deſigned</hi> by the <hi>Church,</hi> nay, by <hi>every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> for ſo he ſays: For if he ſhould yeild it <hi>neceſſary</hi> by this Commandment, to ſet apart <hi>one day in</hi> ſeven, he grants the fourth <hi>Commandment</hi> to be <hi>moral,</hi> for ſo <hi>much time;</hi> which ere long, he will, as others do, deny. There would then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main nothing to be done, but to finde out that <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular day</hi> of ſeven to be <hi>aſſigned</hi> for God and his ſervice, and who hath <hi>power</hi> to do it. For that he is yet more <hi>liberal,</hi> then ſome of his part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>[The firſt day of the week, and accordingly
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:170718:198"/>he ſuppoſes it inſtituted by the Apoſtles of Chriſt.]</hi> Surely, this is one of the Doctors <hi>Free-will-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and we (if not <hi>God</hi>) are much <hi>beholden</hi> to him, if he would not <hi>retract</hi> this gift, which he will do anon; founding the <hi>Lords-day</hi> and his <hi>Feſtivals</hi> on the ſame <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> But I take what he grants, kindly; If the <hi>firſt day</hi> of the week, was by <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> that is, <hi>Divine</hi> Inſtitution, as <hi>one of</hi> ſeven: I ask, by what <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Commandment,</hi> did they, make that <hi>day neceſſary</hi> and <hi>moral,</hi> if not by the fourth Commandment? and then, it's <hi>moral,</hi> not onely for <hi>ſome time,</hi> but for <hi>one day</hi> in ſeven, which will hardly be yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And again, if the <hi>Lords-day</hi> be of <hi>Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> divine inſtitution, according to the fourth Commandment, it is <hi>Holy, above,</hi> not onely all <hi>other</hi> days in the week, but above all his <hi>Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,</hi> for which he hath nothing in the fourth Commandment, nor can prove them of <hi>Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Inſtitution;</hi> the moſt he pretends to, is but <hi>Apostolical practice,</hi> and obſervation.</p>
            <p>And therefore (fearing he hath yeilded too much) he ſtarts back, and ſays, <hi>[As among the Jews,</hi>

For thoſe of <hi>Gods</hi> appointment, we do not think the fourth Commandment <hi>excluſive,</hi> to hinder God, for appointing what <hi>dayes</hi> he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; onely, it preſuppoſing the <hi>power</hi> of ordaining <hi>Holy-days,</hi> to belong to God, it <hi>excludes</hi> men, for
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:170718:199"/>ſetting up any as <hi>holy,</hi> without his leave.

            </p>
            <p>But the Doctor <hi>places the Worſhip</hi> of God in the <hi>obſervation</hi> of a day, which God <hi>(confeſſedly)</hi> hath not <hi>made holy,</hi> his <hi>Feſtival:</hi> This I ſhall prove many wayes. 1. His <hi>Feſtival</hi> is one of his <hi>Free-will-offerings,</hi> which <hi>anciently</hi> was a <hi>part</hi> of Worſhip. 2.

<pb n="401" facs="tcp:170718:202"/>God hath not commanded. 3. He calls the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration</hi> of it, a <hi>voluntary oblation,</hi> (which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>Worſhip.) [An oblation to God in honour to him; Sect.</hi> 59. <hi>Offer it up a voluntary oblation to Chriſt, Sect.</hi> 28.] 4.

            </p>
            <p>[4. <hi>To forbid labours on that day, when they hinder not the publick Worſhip (if God have not made it holy) is ſuperſtitious.</hi>] The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God <hi>allows</hi> men ſix days for their <hi>own</hi> works.

            <p>But the Doctor forbids <hi>labours,</hi> and requires <hi>reſt,</hi> from <hi>ſports,</hi> much more ſure from <hi>labours,</hi> all the day of his <hi>Feſtival:</hi> So he ſays, <hi>Feſt.

And why he ſhould call them <hi>Faſtidious Reflexions,</hi> I know not. The R. Doctor and men of his way, do not love, or do not uſe to <hi>ſtate their queſtions</hi> right, (as in this ſo in other controverſies) that ſo they may have the more liberty, to expatiate in ambiguities. This is evident, in all theſe three Diatribees, of <hi>Superſtition, Will-worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals.</hi> My hardeſt task hath been to finde out the <hi>true ſtate</hi> of the controverſies about them; which I ſaw the Doctor had declined, and when it was done, did labour to obſcure it; why he did ſo, let him now conſider. It's apparent, that in all the three
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:170718:220"/>queſtions, he hath miſtated them. This I ſhewed him in each particular, and all his anſwer is, <hi>Faſtidious Reflexions.</hi> But I had more cauſe to complain, of <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtidious neglects,</hi> and omiſſions. In that, firſt, by not <hi>stating</hi> the queſtion aright, either firſt or laſt, he would inſinuate to his <hi>facile</hi> and <hi>credulous</hi> Reader, that I am of opinion, <hi>[that all Circumſtances of Worſhip, as time and place, &amp;c. when eſtabliſhed by the Church, are unlawful.]</hi> Which I intended onely of <hi>uncommanded Worſhip;</hi> as himſelf hath more then once, acknowledged for me. 2. That he ſo <hi>faſtidiouſly</hi> refuſes to anſwer my four queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, truly ſtating the controverſies betwixt us. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it concern'd the Doctor to have anſwered yea or nay, to affirm or deny them, or to ſhew their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, in the miſtating of them. That he endeavours thus, [<hi>In his propoſing of</hi> 4. <hi>other queſtions,</hi>
